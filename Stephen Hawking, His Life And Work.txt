About the Book 



Stephen Hawking is one of 
the most remarkable figures 
of our time - a Cambridge 
genius who has earned 
international celebrity and 
become an inspiration to 
those who have witnessed his 
triumph over disability. This 
is Hawking 's life story by 



Kitty Ferguson, written with 
help from Hawking himself 
and his close associates. 

Ferguson's Stephen 
Hawking 's Quest for a 
Theory of Everything was a 
Sunday Times bestseller in 
1992. She has now 
transformed that short book 
into a hugely expanded, 
carefully researched, up-to- 
the-minute biography giving 



a rich picture of Hawking 's 
life - his childhood, the heart- 
rending beginning of his 
struggle with motor neurone 
disease, his ever- increasing 
international fame, and his 
long personal battle for 
survival in pursuit of a 
scientific understanding of 
the universe. Throughout, 
Kitty Ferguson also 
summarizes and explains the 
cutting-edge science in which 



Hawking has been engaged. 

Stephen Hawking is written 
with the clarity and simplicity 
for which all Kitty 
Ferguson's books have been 
praised. The result is a 
captivating account of an 
extraordinary life and mind.

PARTI 
1942-1975 



1 



The quest for a 
Theory of Everything' 

1980 

in the centre of Cambridge, 
England, There are a handful 
of narrow lanes that seem 
hardly touched by the 



twentieth or twenty-first 
centuries. The houses and 
buildings represent a mixture 
of eras, but a step around the 
corner from the wider 
thoroughfares into any of 
these little byways is a step 
back in time, into a passage 
leading between old college 
walls or a village street with a 
medieval church and 
churchyard or a malt house. 
Traffic noises from equally 



old but busier roads nearby 
are barely audible. There is 
near silence, birdsong, voices, 
footsteps. Scholars and 
townspeople have walked 
here for centuries. 

When I wrote my first 
book about Stephen Hawking 
in 1990, I began the story in 
one of those little streets, Free 
School Lane. It runs off 
Bene't Street, beside the 
church of St Bene't' s with its 



eleventh-century bell tower. 
Around the corner, in the 
lane, flowers and branches 
still droop through the iron 
palings of the churchyard, as 
they did twenty years ago. 
Bicycles tethered there belie 
the antique feel of the place, 
but a little way along on the 
right is a wall of black, rough 
stones with narrow slit 
windows belonging to the 
fourteenth-century Old Court 



of Corpus Christi College, the 
oldest court in Cambridge. 
Turn your back to that wall 
and you will see, high up 
beside a gothic-style gateway, 
a plaque that reads, the 

CAVENDISH LABORATORY. This 

gateway and the passage 
beyond are a portal to a more 
recent era, oddly tucked away 
in the medieval street. 

There is no hint of the 
friary that stood on this site in 



the twelfth century or the 
gardens that were later 
planted on its ruins. Instead, 
bleak, factory-like buildings, 
almost oppressive enough to 
be a prison, tower over grey 
asphalt pavement. The 
situation improves further 
into the complex, and in the 
two decades since I first 
wrote about it some newer 
buildings have gone up, but 
the glass walls of these well- 



designed modern structures 
are still condemned to reflect 
little besides the grimness of 
their older neighbours. 

For a century, until the 
University of Cambridge built 
the 'New' Cavendish Labs in 
1974, this complex housed 
one of the most important 
centres of physics research in 
the world. Here, 'J. J.' 
Thomson discovered the 
electron, Ernest Rutherford 



probed the structure of the 
atom - and the list goes on 
and on. When I attended 
lectures here in the 1990s (for 
not everything moved to the 
New Cavendish in 1974), 
enormous chalk-boards were 
still in use, hauled noisily up 
and down with crank-driven 
chain-pulley systems to make 
room for the endless strings 
of equations in a physics 
lecture. 



The Cockcroft Lecture 
Room, part of this same site, 
is a much more up-to-date 
lecture room. Here, on 29 
April 1980, scientists, guests 
and university dignitaries 
gathered in steep tiers of 
seats, facing a two-storey 
wall of chalk-board and slide 
screen - still well before the 
advent of PowerPoint. The 
occasion was the inaugural 
lecture of a new Lucasian 



Professor of Mathematics, 
38-year-old mathematician 
and physicist Stephen 
William Hawking. He had 
been named to this illustrious 
chair the previous autumn. 

The title announced for 
his lecture was a question: 'Is 
the End in Sight for 
Theoretical Physics?' 
Hawking startled his listeners 
by announcing that he 
thought it was. He invited 



them to join him in a 
sensational escape through 
time and space on a quest to 
find the Holy Grail of 
science: the theory that 
explains the universe and 
everything that happens in it 
- what some were calling the 
Theory of Everything. 

Watching Stephen 
Hawking, silent in a 
wheelchair while one of his 
students read his lecture for 



the audience, no one 
unacquainted with him would 
have thought he was a 
promising choice to lead such 
an adventure. Theoretical 
physics was for him the great 
escape from a prison more 
grim than any suggested by 
the Old Cavendish Labs. 
Beginning when he was a 
graduate student in his early 
twenties, he had lived with 
encroaching disability and the 



promise of an early death. 
Hawking has amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, known in 
America as Lou Gehrig's 
disease after the New York 
Yankees' first baseman, who 
died of it— The progress of 
the disease in Hawking 's case 
had been slow, but by the 
time he became Lucasian 
Professor he could no longer 
walk, write, feed himself, or 
raise his head if it tipped 



forward. His speech was 
slurred and almost 
unintelligible except to those 
who knew him best. For the 
Lucasian lecture, he had 
painstakingly dictated his text 
earlier, so that it could be 
read by the student. But 
Hawking certainly was and is 
no invalid. He is an active 
mathematician and physicist, 
whom some were even then 
calling the most brilliant 



since Einstein. The Lucasian 
Professorship is an extremely 
prestigious position in the 
University of Cambridge, 
dating from 1663. The second 
holder of the chair was Sir 
Isaac Newton. 

It was typical of 
Hawking 's iconoclasm to 
begin this distinguished 
professorship by predicting 
the end of his own field. He 
said he thought there was a 



good chance the so-called 
Theory of Everything would 
be found before the close of 
the twentieth century, leaving 
little for theoretical physicists 
like himself to do. 

Since that lecture, many 
people have come to think of 
Stephen Hawking as the 
standard-bearer of the quest 
for that theory. However, the 
candidate he named for 
Theory of Everything was not 



one of his own theories but 
'N=8 supergravity', a theory 
which many physicists at that 
time hoped might unify all 
the particles and the forces of 
nature. Hawking is quick to 
point out that his work is only 
one part of a much larger 
picture, involving physicists 
all over the world, and also 
part of a very old quest. The 
longing to understand the 
universe must surely be as 



ancient as human 
consciousness. Ever since 
human beings first began to 
look at the night skies as well 
as at the enormous variety of 
nature around them, and 
considered their own 
existence, they've been trying 
to explain all this with myths, 
religion, and, later, 
mathematics and science. We 
may not be much nearer to 
understanding the complete 



picture than our remotest 
ancestors, but most of us like 
to think, as does Stephen 
Hawking, that we are. 

Hawking 's life story and 
his science continue to be full 
of paradoxes. Things are 
often not what they seem. 
Pieces that should fit together 
refuse to do so. Beginnings 
may be endings; cruel 
circumstances can lead to 
happiness, although fame and 



success may not; two brilliant 
and highly successful 
scientific theories taken 
together yield nonsense; 
empty space isn't empty; 
black holes aren't black; the 
effort to unite everything in a 
simple explanation reveals, 
instead, a fragmented picture; 
and a man whose appearance 
inspires shock and pity takes 
us joyfully to where the 
boundaries of time and space 



ought to be - but are not. 

Anywhere we look in our 
universe, we find that reality 
is astoundingly complex and 
elusive, sometimes alien, not 
always easy to take, and often 
impossible to predict. Beyond 
our universe there may be an 
infinite number of others. The 
close of the twentieth century 
has come and gone, and no 
one has discovered the 
Theory of Everything. Where 



does that leave Stephen 
Hawking 's prediction? Can 
any scientific theory truly 
explain it all? 

fnl There has been recent 
evidence that Gehrig may not 
have had amyotrophic lateral 
sclerosis, but another disease 
similar to it.

'Our goal is nothing 
less than a complete 

description of the 
universe we live in' 

the idea that all the amazing 
intricacy and variety we 
experience in the world and 



the cosmos may come down 
to something remarkably 
simple is not new or far- 
fetched. The sage Pythagoras 
and his followers in southern 
Italy in the sixth century bc 
studied the relationships 
between lengths of strings on 
a lyre and the musical pitches 
these produced, and realized 
that hidden behind the 
confusion and complexity of 
nature there is pattern, order, 



rationality. In the two and a 
half millennia since, our 
forebears have continued to 
find often, like the 

Pythagoreans, to their 
surprise and awe - that nature 
is less complicated than it 
first appears. 

Imagine, if you can, that 
you are a super-intelligent 
alien who has absolutely no 
experience of our universe: is 
there a set of rules so 



complete that by studying 
them you could discover 
exactly what our universe is 
like? Suppose someone 
handed you that rule book. 
Could it possibly be a short 
book? 

For decades, many 
physicists believed that the 
rule book is not lengthy and 
contains a set of fairly simple 
principles, perhaps even just 
one principle that lies behind 



everything that has happened, 
is happening, and ever will 
happen in our universe. In 
1980, Stephen Hawking made 
the brash claim that we would 
hold the rule book in our 
hands by the end of the 
twentieth century. 

My family used to own a 
museum facsimile of an 
ancient board game. 
Archaeologists digging in the 
ruins of the city of Ur in 



Mesopotamia had unearthed 
an exquisite inlaid board with 
a few small carved pieces. It 
was obviously an elaborate 
game, but no one knew its 
rules. The makers of the 
facsimile had tried to deduce 
them from the design of the 
board and pieces, but those 
like ourselves who bought the 
game were encouraged to 
make our own decisions and 
discoveries about how to play 



it. 

You can think of the 
universe as something like 
that: a magnificent, elegant, 
mysterious game. Certainly 
there are rules, but the rule 
book didn't come with the 
game. The universe is no 
beautiful relic like the game 
found at Ur. Yes, it is old, but 
the game continues. We and 
everything we know about 
(and much we do not) are in 



the thick of the play. If there 
is a Theory of Everything, we 
and everything in the 
universe must be obeying its 
principles, even while we try 
to discover what they are. 

You would expect the 
complete, unabridged rules 
for the universe to fill a vast 
library or supercomputer. 
There would be rules for how 
galaxies form and move, for 
how human bodies work and 



fail to work, for how humans 
relate to one another, for how 
subatomic particles interact, 
how water freezes, how 
plants grow, how dogs bark - 
intricate rules within rules 
within rules. How could 
anyone think this could be 
reduced to a few principles? 

Richard Feynman, the 
American physicist and 
Nobel laureate, gave an 
excellent example of the way 



the reduction process 
happens. There was a time, he 
pointed out, when we had 
something we called motion 
and something else called 
heat and something else again 
called sound. 'But it was soon 
discovered,' wrote Feynman: 

after Sir Isaac Newton 
explained the laws of 
motion, that some of 
these apparently 



different things were 
aspects of the same 
thing. For example, 
the phenomena of 
sound could be 
completely 

understood as the 
motion of atoms in the 
air. So sound was no 
longer considered 
something in addition 
to motion. It was also 
discovered that heat 



phenomena are easily 
understandable from 
the laws of motion. In 
this way, great globs 
of physics theory were 
synthesized into a 
simplified theory.' 1 

Life among the Small 
Pieces 

All matter as we normally 
think of it in the universe - 



you and I, air, ice, stars, 
gases, microbes, this book - 
is made up of minuscule 
building blocks called atoms. 
Atoms in turn are made up of 
smaller objects, called 
particles, and a lot of empty 
space. 

The most familiar matter 
particles are the electrons that 
orbit the nuclei of atoms and 
the protons and neutrons that 
are clustered in the nuclei. 



Protons and neutrons are 
made up of even tinier 
particles of matter called 
'quarks'. All matter particles 
belong to a class of particles 
called 'fermions', named for 
the great Italian physicist 
Enrico Fermi. They have a 
system of messages that pass 
among them, causing them to 
act and change in various 
ways. A group of humans 
might have a message system 



consisting of four different 
services: telephone, fax, e- 
mail and 'snail mail'. Not all 
the humans would send and 
receive messages and 
influence one another by 
means of all four message 
services. You can think of the 
message system among the 
fermions as four such 
message services, called 
forces. There is another class 
of particles that carry these 



messages among the 
fermions, and sometimes 
among themselves as well: 
'messenger' particles, more 
properly called 'bosons'. 
Apparently every particle in 
the universe is either a 
fermion or a boson. 

One of the four 
fundamental forces of nature 
is gravity. One way of 
thinking about the 
gravitational force holding us 



to the Earth is as 'messages' 
carried by bosons called 
gravitons between the 
particles of the atoms in your 
body and the particles of the 
atoms in the Earth, 
influencing these particles to 
draw closer to one another. 
Gravity is the weakest of the 
forces, but, as we'll see later, 
it is a very long-range force 
and acts on everything in the 
universe. When it adds up, it 



can dominate all the other 
forces. 

A second force, the 
electromagnetic force, is 
messages carried by bosons 
called photons among the 
protons in the nucleus of an 
atom, between the protons 
and the electrons nearby, and 
among electrons. The 
electromagnetic force causes 
electrons to orbit the nucleus. 
On the level of everyday 



experience, photons show up 
as light, heat, radio waves, 
microwaves and other waves, 
all known as electromagnetic 
radiation. The 
electromagnetic force is also 
long-range and much stronger 
than gravity, but it acts only 
on particles with an electric 
charge. 

A third message service, 
the strong nuclear force, 
causes the nucleus of the 



atom to hold together. 

A fourth, the weak 
nuclear force, causes 
radioactivity and plays a 
necessary role, in stars and in 
the early universe, in the 
formation of the elements. 

The gravitational force, 
the electromagnetic force, the 
strong nuclear force, and the 
weak nuclear force ... the 
activities of those four forces 
are responsible for all 



messages among all fermions 
in the universe and for all 
interactions among them. 
Without the four forces, every 
fermion (every particle of 
matter) would exist, if it 
existed at all, in isolation, 
with no means of contacting 
or influencing any other, 
oblivious to every other. To 
put it bluntly, whatever 
doesn't happen by means of 
one of the four forces doesn't 



happen. If that is true, a 
complete understanding of 
the forces would give us an 
understanding of the 
principles underlying 
everything that happens in the 
universe. Already we have a 
remarkably condensed rule 
book. 

Much of the work of 
physicists in the twentieth 
century was aimed at learning 
more about how the four 



forces of nature operate and 
how they are related. In our 
human message system, we 
might discover that 
telephone, fax and e-mail are 
not really so separate after all, 
but can be thought of as the 
same thing showing up in 
three different ways. That 
discovery would 'unify' the 
three message services. In a 
similar way, physicists have 
sought, with some success, to 



unify the forces. They hope 
ultimately to find a theory 
which explains all four forces 
as one showing up in 
different ways - a theory that 
may even unite both fermions 
and bosons in a single family. 
They speak of such a theory 
as a unified theory. 

A theory explaining the 
universe, the Theory of 
Everything, must go several 
steps further. Of particular 



interest to Stephen Hawking, 
it must answer the question, 
what was the universe like at 
the instant of beginning, 
before any time whatsoever 
had passed? Physicists phrase 
that question: what are the 
'initial conditions' or the 
'boundary conditions at the 
beginning of the universe'? 
Because this issue of 
boundary conditions has been 
and continues to be at the 



heart of Hawking 's work, it 
behooves us to spend a little 
time with it. 

The Boundary 
Challenge 

Suppose you put together a 
layout for a model railway, 
then position several trains on 
the tracks and set the switches 
and throttles controlling the 
train speeds as you want 



them, all before turning on 
the power. You have set up 
boundary conditions. For this 
session with your train set, 
reality is going to begin with 
things in precisely this state 
and not in any other. Where 
each train will be five 
minutes after you turn on the 
power, whether any train will 
crash with another, depends 
heavily on these boundary 
conditions. 



Imagine that when you 
have allowed the trains to run 
for ten minutes, without any 
interference, a friend enters 
the room. You switch off the 
power. Now you have a 
second set of boundary 
conditions: the precise 
position of everything in the 
layout at the second you 
switched it off. Suppose you 
challenge your friend to try to 
work out exactly where all 



the trains started out ten 
minutes earlier. There would 
be a host of questions besides 
the simple matter of where 
the trains are standing and 
how the throttles and 
switches are set. How quickly 
does each of the trains 
accelerate and slow down? 
Do certain parts of the tracks 
offer more resistance than 
others? How steep are the 
gradients? Is the power 



supply constant? Is it certain 
there has been nothing to 
interfere with the running of 
the train set - something no 
longer evident? The whole 
exercise would indeed be 
daunting. Your friend would 
be in something like the 
position of a modern 
physicist trying to work out 
how the universe began - 
what were the boundary 
conditions at the beginning of 



time. 

Boundary conditions in 
science do not apply only to 
the history of the universe. 
They simply mean the lie of 
the land at a particular point 
in time, for instance the start 
of an experiment in a 
laboratory. However, unlike 
the situation with the train set 
or a lab experiment, when 
considering the universe, one 
is often not allowed to set up 



boundary conditions. One of 
Hawking ' s favourite 
questions is how many ways 
the universe could have 
begun and still ended up the 
way we observe it today, 
assuming that we have 
correct knowledge and 
understanding of the laws of 
physics and they have not 
changed. He is using 'the way 
we observe the universe 
today' as a boundary 



condition and also, in a more 
subtle sense, using the laws 
of physics and the assumption 
that they have not changed as 
boundary conditions. The 
answer he is after is the reply 
to the question, what were the 
boundary conditions at the 
beginning of the universe, or 
the 'initial conditions of the 
universe' - the exact layout at 
the word go, including the 
minimal laws that had to be 



in place at that moment in 
order to produce at a certain 
time in the future the universe 
as we know it today? It is in 
considering this question that 
he has produced some of his 
most interesting work and 
surprising answers. 

A unified description of 
the particles and forces, and 
knowledge of the boundary 
conditions for the origin of 
the universe, would be a 



stupendous scientific 
achievement, but it would not 
be a Theory of Everything. In 
addition, such a theory must 
account for values that are 
'arbitrary elements' in all 
present theories. 



Language Lesson 

Arbitrary elements include 
such 'constants of nature' as 
the mass and charge of the 
electron and the velocity of 



light. We observe what these 
are, but no theory explains or 
predicts them. Another 
example: physicists know the 
strength of the 

electromagnetic force and the 
weak nuclear force. The 
electroweak theory is a theory 
that unifies the two, but it 
cannot tell us how to 
calculate the difference in 
strength between the two 
forces. The difference in 



strength is an 'arbitrary 
element', not predicted by the 
theory. We know what it is 
from observation, and so we 
put it into a theory 'by hand'. 
This is considered a weakness 
in a theory. 

When scientists use the 
word predict, they do not 
mean telling the future. The 
question 'Does this theory 
predict the speed of light?' 
isn't asking whether the 



theory tells us what that speed 
will be next Tuesday. It 
means, would this theory 
make it possible for us to 
work out the speed of light if 
it were impossible to observe 
what that speed is? As it 
happens, no present theory 
does predict the speed of 
light. It is an arbitrary 
element in all theories. 

One of Hawking 's 
concerns when he wrote A 



Brief History of Time was that 
there be a clear understanding 
of what is meant by a theory. 
A theory is not Truth with a 
capital T, not a rule, not fact, 
not the final word. You might 
think of a theory as a toy 
boat. To find out whether it 
floats, you set it on the water. 
You test it. When it 
flounders, you pull it out of 
the water and make some 
changes, or you start again 



and build a different boat, 
benefiting from what you've 
learned from the failure. 

Some theories are good 
boats. They float a long time. 
We may know there are a few 
leaks, but for all practical 
purposes they serve us well. 
Some serve us so well, and 
are so solidly supported by 
experiment and testing, that 
we begin to regard them as 
truth. Scientists, keeping in 



mind how complex and 
surprising our universe is, are 
extremely wary about calling 
them that. Although some 
theories do have a lot of 
experimental success to back 
them up and others are hardly 
more than a glimmer in a 
theorist's eyes - brilliantly 
designed boats that have 
never been tried on the water 
- it is risky to assume that 
any of them is absolute, 



fundamental scientific 'truth'. 

It is important, however, 
not to dither around for ever, 
continuing to call into 
question well-established 
theories without having a 
good reason for doing so. For 
science to move ahead, it is 
necessary to decide whether 
some theories are dependable 
enough, and match 
observation sufficiently well, 
to allow us to use them as 



building blocks and proceed 
from there. Of course, some 
new thought or discovery 
might come along and 
threaten to sink the boat. 
We'll see an example of that 
later in this book. 

In A Brief History of Time 
Stephen Hawking wrote that 
a scientific theory is 'just a 
model of the universe, or a 
restricted part of it, and a set 
of rules that relate quantities 



in the model to observations 
that we make. It exists only in 
our minds and does not have 
any other reality (whatever 
that may mean).' 2 The easiest 
way to understand this 
definition is to look at some 
examples. 

There is a film clip 
showing Hawking teaching a 
class of graduate students, 
probably in the early 1980s, 
with the help of his graduate 



assistant. By this time 
Hawking 's ability to speak 
had deteriorated so seriously 
that it was impossible for 
anyone who did not know 
him well to understand him. 
In the clip, his graduate 
assistant interprets Hawking' s 
garbled speech to say, 'Now 
it just so happens that we 
have a model of the universe 
here', and places a large 
cardboard cylinder upright on 



the seminar table. Hawking 
frowns and mutters 
something that only the 
assistant can understand. The 
assistant apologetically picks 
up the cylinder and turns it 
over to stand on its other end. 
Hawking nods approval, to 
general laughter. 

A 'model', of course, 
does not have to be 
something like a cardboard 
cylinder or a drawing that we 



can see and touch. It can be a 
mental picture or even a 
story. Mathematical equations 
or creation myths can be 
models. 

Getting back to the 
cardboard cylinder, how does 
it resemble the universe? To 
make a full-fledged theory 
out of it, Hawking would 
have to explain how the 
model is related to what we 
actually see around us, to 



'observations', or to what we 
might observe if we had 
better technology. However, 
just because someone sets a 
piece of cardboard on the 
table and tells how it is 
related to the actual universe 
does not mean anyone should 
accept this as the model of 
the universe. We are to 
consider it, not swallow it 
hook, line and sinker. It is an 
idea, existing 'only in our 



minds'. The cardboard 
cylinder may turn out to be a 
useful model. On the other 
hand, some evidence may 
turn up to prove that it is not. 
We shall have found that we 
are part of a slightly different 
game from the one the model 
suggested we were playing. 
Would that mean the theory 
was 'bad'? No, it may have 
been a very good theory, and 
everyone may have learned a 



great deal from considering it, 
testing it, and having to 
change it or discard it. The 
effort to shoot it down may 
have required innovative 
thinking and experiments that 
will lead to something more 
successful or pay off in other 
ways. 

What is it then that makes 
a theory a good theory? 
Quoting Hawking again, it 
must 'accurately describe a 



large class of observations on 
the basis of a model that 
contains only a few arbitrary 
elements, and it must make 
definite predictions about the 
results of future 

observations'. - 

For example, Isaac 
Newton's theory of gravity 
describes a very large class of 
observations. It predicts the 
behaviour of objects dropped 
or thrown on Earth, as well as 



planetary orbits. 

It's important to 
remember, however, that a 
good theory does not have to 
arise entirely from 
observation. A good theory 
can be a wild theory, a great 
leap of imagination. 'The 
ability to make these intuitive 
leaps is really what 
characterizes a good 
theoretical physicist,' says 
Hawking.- However, a good 



theory should not be at odds 
with things already observed, 
unless it gives convincing 
reasons for seeming to be at 
odds. Superstring theory, one 
of the most exciting current 
theories, predicts more than 
three dimensions of space, a 
prediction that certainly 
seems inconsistent with 
observation. Theorists explain 
the discrepancy by suggesting 
the extra dimensions are 



curled up so small we are 
unable to recognize them. 

We've already seen what 
Hawking means by his 
second requirement, that a 
theory contain only a few 
arbitrary elements. 

The final requirement, 
according to Hawking, is that 
it must suggest what to expect 
from future observations. It 
must challenge us to test it. It 
must tell us what we will 



observe if the theory is 
correct. It should also tell us 
what observations would 
prove that it is not correct. 
For example, Albert 
Einstein's theory of general 
relativity predicts that beams 
of light from distant stars 
bend a certain amount as they 
pass massive bodies like the 
sun. This prediction is 
testable. Tests have shown 
Einstein was correct. 



Some theories, including 
most of Stephen Hawking 's, 
are impossible to test with our 
present technology, perhaps 
even with any conceivable 
future technology. They are 
tested with mathematics. 
They must be mathematically 
consistent with what we do 
know and observe. But we 
cannot observe the universe 
in its earliest stages to find 
out directly whether his 'no- 



boundary proposal' (to be 
discussed later) is correct. 
Although some tests were 
proposed for proving or 
disproving 6 wormholes ' , 
Hawking does not think they 
would succeed. But he has 
told us what he thinks we will 
find if we ever do have the 
technology, and he is 
convinced that his theories 
are consistent with what we 
have observed so far. In some 



cases he has risked making 
some very specific 
predictions about the results 
of experiments and 
observations that push at the 
boundaries of our present 
capabilities. 

If nature is perfectly 
unified, then the boundary 
conditions at the beginning of 
the universe, the most 
fundamental particles and the 
forces that govern them, and 



the constants of nature, are 
interrelated in a unique and 
completely compatible way, 
which we might be able to 
recognize as inevitable, 
absolute and self-explanatory. 
To reach that level of 
understanding would indeed 
be to discover the Theory of 
Everything ... of Absolutely 
Everything ... even the 
answer, perhaps, to the 
question of why does the 



universe fit this description 
... to 'know the Mind of 
God', as Hawking termed it 
in A Brief History of Time, or 
'the Grand Design', as he 
would phrase it less 
dramatically in a more recent 
book by that name. 

Laying Down the 
Gauntlet 

We are ready to list the 



challenges that faced any 
'Theory of Everything' 
candidate when Hawking 
delivered his Lucasian 
Lecture in 1980. You'll learn 
in due course how some 
requirements in this list have 
changed subtly since then. 

• It must give us 
a model that 
unifies the 
forces and 



particles. 

• It must answer 
the question, 
what were the 
'boundary 
conditions' of 
the universe, 
the conditions 
at the very 
instant of 
beginning, 
before any time 
whatsoever 



passed? 

• It must be 
'restrictive', 
allowing few 
options. It 
should, for 
instance, 
predict 

precisely how 
many types of 
particles there 
are. If it leaves 
options, it must 



somehow 
account for the 
fact that we 
have the 
universe we 
have and not a 
slightly 
different one. 

• It should 
contain few 
arbitrary 
elements. We 
would rather 



not have to 
peek too often 
at the actual 
universe for 
answers. 
Paradoxically, 
the Theory of 
Everything 
itself may be 
an arbitrary 
element. Few 
scientists 
expect it to 



explain why 
there should 
exist either a 
theory or 
anything at all 
for it to 
describe. It is 
not likely to 
answer Stephen 
Hawking 's 
question: 'Why 
does the 
universe [or, 



for that matter, 
the Theory of 
Everything] go 
to all the bother 
of existing?'- 

• It must predict 
a universe like 
the universe we 
observe or else 
explain 
convincingly 
why there are 
discrepancies. 



If it predicts 
that the speed 
of light is ten 
miles per hour, 
or disallows 
penguins or 
pulsars, we 
have a 
problem. A 
Theory of 
Everything 
must find a 
way to survive 



comparison 
with what we 
observe. 

• It should be 
simple, 

although it 
must allow for 
enormous 
complexity. 
The physicist 
John Archibald 
Wheeler of 
Princeton 



wrote: 

Behind it all 
is surely an 

idea so 

simple, 
so beautiful, 
so 

compelling 
that when 



in a decade, 
a century, 
or a 



millennium 

we grasp it, 
we will all 

say to 

each 

other, 
how could it 

have been 

otherwise? 
How could 

we have 

been so 



stupid 
for so long? 

6 

The most 
profound 
theories, such as 
Newton's theory 
of gravity and 
Einstein's 
relativity 
theories, are 
simple in the way 
Wheeler 



described. 

• It must solve 
the enigma of 
combining 
Einstein's 
theory of 
general 

relativity (a 
theory that 
explains 
gravity) with 
quantum 
mechanics (the 



theory we use 
successfully 
when talking 
about the other 
three forces). 
This is a 
challenge that 
Stephen 
Hawking has 
taken up. We 
introduce the 
problem here. 
You will 



understand it 
better after 
reading about 
the uncertainty 
principle of 
quantum 
mechanics in 
this chapter 
and about 
general 

relativity later. 



Theory Meets Theory 



Einstein's theory of general 
relativity is the theory of the 
large and the very large - 
stars, planets, galaxies, for 
instance. It does an excellent 
job of explaining how gravity 
works on that level. 

Quantum mechanics is the 
theory of the very small. It 
describes the forces of nature 
as messages among fermions 
(matter particles). Quantum 
mechanics also contains 



something extremely 
frustrating, the uncertainty 
principle: we can never know 
precisely both the position of 
a particle and its momentum 
(how it is moving) at the 
same time. In spite of this 
problem, quantum mechanics 
does an excellent job of 
explaining things on the level 
of the very small. 

One way to combine 
these two great twentieth- 



century theories into one 
unified theory would be to 
explain gravity, more 
successfully than has been 
possible so far, as an 
exchange of messenger 
particles, as we do with the 
other three forces. Another 
avenue is to rethink general 
relativity in the light of the 
uncertainty principle. 

Explaining gravity as an 
exchange of messenger 



particles presents problems. 
When you think of the force 
holding you to the Earth as 
the exchange of gravitons 
(messenger particles of 
gravity) between the matter 
particles in your body and the 
matter particles that make up 
the Earth, you are describing 
the gravitational force in a 
quantum-mechanical way. 
But because all these 
gravitons are also exchanging 



gravitons among themselves, 
mathematically this is a 
messy business. We get 
infinities, mathematical 
nonsense. 

Physical theories cannot 
really handle infinities. When 
they have appeared in other 
theories, theorists have 
resorted to something known 
as 'renormalization'. Richard 
Feynman used 
renormalization when he 



developed a theory to explain 
the electromagnetic force, but 
he was far from pleased about 
it. 'No matter how clever the 
word,' he wrote, 'it is what I 
would call a dippy process!' 2 
It involves putting in other 
infinities and letting the 
infinities cancel each other 
out. It does sound dubious, 
but in many cases it seems to 
work in practice. The 
resulting theories agree with 



observation remarkably well. 

Renormalization works in 
the case of electromagnetism, 
but it fails in the case of 
gravity. The infinities in the 
gravitational force are of a 
much nastier breed than those 
in the electromagnetic force. 
They refuse to go away. 
Supergravity, the theory 
Hawking spoke about in his 
Lucasian lecture, and 
superstring theory, in which 



the basic objects in the 
universe are not pointlike 
particles but tiny strings or 
loops of string, began to 
make promising inroads in 
the twentieth century; and 
later in this book we shall be 
looking at even more 
promising recent 
developments. But the 
problem is not completely 
solved. 

On the other hand, what if 



we allow quantum mechanics 
to invade the study of the 
very large, the realm where 
gravity seems to reign 
supreme? What happens 
when we rethink what general 
relativity tells us about 
gravity in the light of what 
we know about the 
uncertainty principle, the 
principle that you can't 
measure accurately the 
position and the momentum 



of a particle at the same time? 
Hawking 's work along these 
lines has had bizarre results: 
black holes aren't black, and 
the boundary conditions may 
be that there are no 
boundaries. 

While we are listing 
paradoxes, here's another: 
empty space isn't empty. 
Later in this book we'll 
discuss how we arrive at that 
conclusion. For now be 



content to know that the 
uncertainty principle means 
that so-called empty space 
teems with particles and 
antiparticles. (The matter- 
antimatter used in science 
fiction is a familiar example.) 

General relativity tells us 
that the presence of matter or 
energy makes spacetime 
curve, or warp. We've 
already mentioned one result 
of that curvature: the bending 



of light beams from distant 
stars as they pass a massive 
body like the sun. 

Keep those two points in 
mind: (1) 'Empty' space is 
filled with particles and 
antiparticles, adding up to an 
enormous amount of energy. 
(2) The presence of this 
energy causes curvature of 
spacetime. 

If both are true the entire 
universe ought to be curled 



up into a small ball. This 
hasn't happened. When 
general relativity and 
quantum mechanics work 
together, what they predict 
seems to be dead wrong. Both 
general relativity and 
quantum mechanics are 
exceptionally good theories, 
two of the outstanding 
intellectual achievements of 
the twentieth century. They 
serve us magnificently not 



only for theoretical purposes 
but in many practical ways. 
Nevertheless, put together 
they yield infinities and 
nonsense. The Theory of 
Everything must somehow 
resolve that nonsense. 

Predicting the Details 

Once again imagine that you 
are an alien who has never 
seen our universe. With the 
Theory of Everything you 



ought nevertheless to be able 
to predict everything about it 
. . . right? It's possible you can 
predict suns and planets and 
galaxies and black holes and 
quasars - but can you predict 
next year's Derby winner? 
How specific can you be? Not 
very. 

The calculations 
necessary to study all the data 
in the universe are 
ludicrously far beyond the 



capacity of any imaginable 
computer. Hawking points 
out that although we can 
solve the equations for the 
movement of two bodies in 
Newton's theory of gravity, 
we can't solve them exactly 
for three bodies, not because 
Newton's theory doesn't 
work for three bodies but 
because the maths is too 
complicated. The real 
universe, needless to say, has 



more than three bodies in it. 

Nor can we predict our 
health, although we 
understand the principles that 
underlie medicine, the 
principles of chemistry and 
biology, extremely well. The 
problem again is that there 
are too many billions upon 
billions of details in a real-life 
system, even when that 
system is just one human 
body. 



With the Theory of 
Everything in our hands we'd 
still be a staggeringly long 
way from predicting 
everything. Even if the 
underlying principles are 
simple and well understood, 
the way they work out is 
enormously complicated. ' A 
minute to learn, the lifetime 
of the universe to master', to 
paraphrase an advertising 
slogan. 'Lifetime of the 



universe to master' is a gross 
understatement.— 

Where does that leave us? 
What horse will win the 
Grand National next year is 
predictable with the Theory 
of Everything, but no 
computer can hold all the data 
or do the maths to make the 
prediction. Is that correct? 

There's a further problem. 
We must look again at the 
uncertainty principle of 



quantum mechanics. 



The Fuzziness of the 
Very Small 

At the level of the very small, 
the quantum level of the 
universe, the uncertainty 
principle also limits our 
ability to predict. 

Think of all those odd, 
busy inhabitants of the 
quantum world, both 



fermions and bosons. They're 
an impressive zoo of 
particles. Among the 
fermions there are electrons, 
protons and neutrons. Each 
proton or neutron is, in turn, 
made up of three quarks, 
which are also fermions. 
Then we have the bosons: 
photons (messengers of the 
electromagnetic force), 
gravitons (the gravitational 
force), gluons (the strong 



force), and Ws and Zs (the 
weak force). It would be 
helpful to know where all 
these and many others are, 
where they are going, and 
how quickly they are getting 
there. Is it possible to find 
out? 

The diagram of an atom 
in Figure 2.1 is the model 
proposed by Ernest 
Rutherford at the Cavendish 
Labs in Cambridge early in 



the twentieth century. It 
shows electrons orbiting the 
nucleus of the atom as planets 
orbit the sun. We now know 
that things never really look 
like this on the quantum 
level. The orbits of electrons 
cannot be plotted as though 
electrons were planets. We do 
better to picture them 
swarming in a cloud around 
the nucleus. Why the blur? 
The uncertainty principle 



makes life at the quantum 
level a fuzzy, imprecise 
affair, not only for electrons 
but for all the particles. 
Regardless of how we go 
about trying to observe what 
happens, it is impossible to 
find out precisely both the 
momentum and the position 
of a particle at the same time. 
The more accurately we 
measure how the particle is 
moving, the less accurately 



we know its position, and 
vice versa. It works like a 
seesaw: when the accuracy of 
one measurement goes up, the 
accuracy of the other must go 
down. We pin down one 
measurement only by 
allowing the other to become 
more uncertain. 



Electrons twith negatre 
electrical charge) can't be 
in the nucleus, but they 
are attracted to protons 
and tend to stay nearby. 



Notice how much 
empty space there 
is in an atom. 



Electron , 



Protons (with positive electrical 
charge) and neutrons (with no 
electrical charge) cluster together at 
the centre of the atom, in the nucleus 




Even at this magnification, the 
electron and the nucleus are so 
small that you really couldn't see 
them at all. 



Figure 2.1. In the Rutherford 
model of a helium atom, the 
electrons orbit the nucleus the way 
planets orbit the sun. We now 
know that, because of the 



uncertainty principle of quantum 
mechanics, electron orbits are not 
really well-defined paths as shown 
in this model. 

The best way to describe 
the activity of a particle is to 
study all the possible ways it 
might be moving and then 
calculate how likely one way 
is as opposed to another. It 
becomes a matter of 
probabilities. A particle has 
this probability to be moving 



- that way - or it has that 
probability to be - here. 
Those probabilities are 
nevertheless very useful 
information. 

It's a little like predicting 
the outcome of elections. 
Election poll experts work 
with probabilities. When they 
deal with large enough 
numbers of voters, they come 
up with statistics that allow 
them to predict who will win 



the election and by what 
margin, without having to 
know how each individual 
will vote. When quantum 
physicists study a large 
number of possible paths that 
particles might follow, the 
probabilities of their moving 
thus and so or of being in one 
place rather than another 
become concrete information. 

Pollsters admit that 
interviewing an individual 



can influence a vote by 
causing the voter to become 
more aware of issues. 
Physicists have a similar 
dilemma. Probing the 
quantum level influences the 
answers they find. 

Thus far the comparison 
between predicting elections 
and studying the quantum 
level seems a good one. Now 
it breaks down: on election 
day, each voter does cast a 



definite vote one way or 
another, secret perhaps but 
not uncertain. If pollsters 
placed hidden cameras in 
voting booths - and were not 
arrested - they could find out 
how each individual voted. It 
is not like that in quantum 
physics. Physicists have 
devised ingenious ways of 
sneaking up on particles, all 
to no avail. The world of 
elementary particles does not 



just seem uncertain because 
we haven't been clever 
enough to find a successful 
way to observe it. It really is 
uncertain. No wonder 
Hawking, in his Lucasian 
lecture, called quantum 
mechanics ' a theory of what 
we do not know and cannot 
predict'. - 

Taking this limitation into 
account, physicists have 
redefined the goal of science: 



the Theory of Everything will 
be a set of laws that make it 
possible to predict events up 
to the limit set by the 
uncertainty principle, and 
that means in many cases 
satisfying ourselves with 
statistical probabilities, not 
specifics. 

Hawking sums up our 
problem. In answer to the 
question of whether 
everything is predetermined 



either by the Theory of 
Everything or by God, he 
says yes, he thinks it is. 'But 
it might as well not be, 
because we can never know 
what is determined. If the 
theory has determined that we 
shall die by hanging, then we 
shall not drown. But you 
would have to be awfully sure 
that you were destined for the 
gallows to put to sea in a 
small boat during a storm.'- 



He regards the idea of free 
will as 'a very good 
approximate theory of human 
behaviour '.— 

Is There Really a 
Theory of 
Everything? 

Not all physicists believe 
there is a Theory of 
Everything, or, if there is, that 
it is possible for anyone to 



find it. Science may go on 
refining what we know by 
making discovery after 
discovery, opening boxes 
within boxes but never 
arriving at the ultimate box. 
Others argue that events are 
not entirely predictable but 
happen in a random fashion. 
Some believe God and human 
beings have far more freedom 
of give-and-take within this 
creation than a deterministic 



Theory of Everything would 
allow. They believe that as in 
the performance of a great 
piece of orchestral music, 
though the notes are written 
down, there may yet be 
enormous creativity in the 
playing of the notes that is 
not at all predetermined. 

Whether a complete 
theory to explain the universe 
is within our reach or ever 
will be, there are those among 



us who want to make a try. 
Humans are intrepid beings 
with insatiable curiosity. 
Some, like Stephen Hawking, 
are particularly hard to 
discourage. One spokesman 
for those who are engaged in 
this science, Murray Gell- 
Mann, described the quest: 

It is the most 
persistent and greatest 
adventure in human 



history, this search to 
understand the 
universe, how it 
works and where it 
came from. It is 
difficult to imagine 
that a handful of 
residents of a small 
planet circling an 
insignificant star in a 
small galaxy have as 
their aim a complete 
understanding of the 



entire universe, a 
small speck of 
creation truly 
believing it is capable 
of comprehending the 
whole. 11 



fnl The advertising slogan 
for the game Othello is 'A 
minute to learn, a lifetime to 
master'. 



'Equal to anything!' 



WHEN STEPHEN HAWKING was 

twelve years old, two of his 
schoolmates made a bet about 
his future. John McClenahan 
bet that Stephen 'would never 
come to anything'; Basil 
King, that he would 'turn out 



to be unusually capable'. 1 The 
stake was a bag of sweets. 

Young S. W. Hawking 
was no prodigy. Some reports 
claim he was brilliant in a 
haphazard way, but Hawking 
remembers that he was just 
another ordinary English 
schoolboy, slow learning to 
read, his handwriting the 
despair of his teachers. He 
ranked no more than halfway 
up in his school class, though 



he now says, in his defence, 
'It was a very bright class. '- 
Maybe someone might have 
predicted a career in science 
or engineering from the fact 
that Stephen was intensely 
interested in learning the 
secrets of how things such as 
clocks and radios work. He 
took them apart to find out, 
but he could seldom put them 
back together. Stephen was 
never well-coordinated 



physically, and he was not 
keen on sports or other 
physical activities. He was 
almost always the last to be 
chosen for any sports team. 
John McClenahan had good 
reason to think he would win 
the wager. 

Basil King probably was 
just being a loyal friend or 
liked betting on long shots. 
Maybe he did see things 
about Stephen that teachers, 



parents and Stephen himself 
couldn't see. He hasn't 
claimed his bag of sweets, but 
it's time he did. Because 
Stephen Hawking, after such 
an unexceptional beginning, 
is now one of the intellectual 
giants of our modern world - 
and among its most heroic 
figures. How such 
transformations happen is a 
mystery that biographical 
details alone cannot explain. 



Hawking would have it that 
he is still 'just a child who 
has never grown up. I still 
keep asking these how and 
why questions. Occasionally I 
find an answer. '- 

1942-1959 

Stephen William Hawking 
was born during the Second 
World War, on 8 January 
1942, in Oxford. It was a 
winter of discouragement and 



fear, not a happy time to be 
born. Hawking likes to recall 
that his birth was exactly 
three hundred years after the 
death of Galileo, who is 
called the father of modern 
science. But few people in 
January 1942 were thinking 
about Galileo. 

Stephen's parents, Frank 
and Isobel Hawking, were not 
wealthy. Frank's very 
prosperous Yorkshire 



grandfather had over- 
extended himself buying farm 
land and then gone bankrupt 
in the great agricultural 
depression of the early 
twentieth century. His 
resilient wife, Frank's 
grandmother and Stephen's 
great-grandmother, saved the 
family from complete ruin by 
opening a school in their 
home. Her ability and 
willingness to take this 



unusual step are evidence that 
reading and education must 
already have been a high 
priority in the family. 

Isobel, Stephen's mother, 
was the second oldest of 
seven children. Her father 
was a family doctor in 
Glasgow. When Isobel was 
twelve, they moved to Devon. 

It wasn't easy for either 
family to scrape together 
money to send a child to 



Oxford, but in both cases they 
did. Taking on a financial 
burden of this magnitude was 
especially unusual in the case 
of Isobel's parents, for few 
women went to university in 
the 1930s. Though Oxford 
had been admitting female 
students since 1878, it was 
only in 1920 that the 
university had begun granting 
degrees to women. Isobel's 
studies ranged over an 



unusually wide curriculum in 
a university where students 
tended to be much more 
specialized than in an 
American liberal arts college 
or university. She studied 
philosophy, politics and 
economics.- 

Stephen's father Frank 
was a meticulous, determined 
young man who kept a 
journal every day from the 
age of fourteen and would 



continue it until the end of his 
life.- He was at Oxford earlier 
than Isobel, studying medical 
science with a speciality in 
tropical medicine. When the 
Second World War broke out 
he was in East Africa doing 
field research, and he 
intrepidly found his way 
overland to take ship for 
England and volunteer for 
military service. He was 
assigned instead to medical 



research. 

Isobel held several jobs 
after graduation from Oxford, 
all of them beneath her ability 
and credentials as a university 
graduate. One was as an 
inspector of taxes. She so 
loathed that that she gave it 
up in disgust to become a 
secretary at a medical 
institute in Hampstead. There 
she met Frank Hawking. 
They were married in the 



early years of the war. 

In January 1942 the 
Hawkings were living in 
Highgate, north London. In 
the London area hardly a 
night passed without air raids, 
and Frank and Isobel 
Hawking decided Isobel 
should go to Oxford to give 
birth to their baby in safety. 
Germany was not bombing 
Oxford or Cambridge, the 
two great English university 



towns, reputedly in return for 
a British promise not to bomb 
Heidelberg and Gottingen. In 
Oxford, the city familiar from 
her recent university days, 
Isobel spent the final week of 
her pregnancy first in a hotel 
and then, as the birth grew 
imminent and the hotel grew 
nervous, in hospital, but she 
was still able to go out for 
walks to fill her time. On one 
of those leisurely winter days, 



she happened into a bookshop 
and, with a book token, 
bought an astronomical atlas. 
She would later regard this as 
a rather prophetic purchase.- 

Not long after Stephen's 
birth on 8 January his parents 
took him back to Highgate. 
Their home survived the war, 
although a V-2 rocket hit a 
few doors away when the 
Hawkings were absent, 
blowing out the back 



windows of their house and 
leaving glass shards sticking 
out of the opposite wall like 
little daggers. 2 It had been a 
good moment to be 
somewhere else. 

After the war the family 
lived in Highgate until 1950. 
Stephen's sister Mary was 
born there in 1943 (when 
Stephen was less than two 
years old), and a second 
daughter, Philippa, arrived in 



1946. The family would 
adopt another son, Edward, in 
1955, when Stephen was a 
teenager. In Highgate 
Stephen attended the Byron 
House School, whose 
'progressive methods' he 
would later blame for his not 
learning to read until after he 
left there. 

When Dr Frank Hawking, 
beginning to be recognized as 
a brilliant leader in his field, 



became head of the Division 
of Parasitology at the 
National Institute for Medical 
Research, the family moved 
to St Albans. 

Eccentric in St 
Albans 

The Hawkings were a close 
family. Their home was full 
of good books and good 
music, often reverberating 



with the operas of Richard 
Wagner played at high 
volume on the record player. 
Frank and Isobel Hawking 
believed strongly in the value 
of education, a good bit of it 
occurring at home. Frank 
gave his children a grounding 
in, among other things, 
astronomy and surveying, and 
Isobel took them often to the 
museums in South 
Kensington, where each child 



had a favourite museum and 
none had the slightest interest 
in the others' favourites. She 
would leave Stephen in the 
Science Museum and Mary in 
the Natural History Museum, 
and then stay with Philippa - 
too young to be left alone - at 
the Victoria and Albert. After 
a while she would collect 
them all again.- 

In St Albans the 
Hawkings were regarded as a 



highly intelligent, eccentric 
family. Their love of books 
extended to such compulsive 
reading habits that Stephen's 
friends found it odd and a 
little rude of his family to sit 
at the dining table, 
uncommunicative, their noses 
buried in their books. Reports 
that the family car was a used 
hearse are false. For many 
years the Hawkings drove 
around in a succession of 



used London taxis of the 
black, boxlike sort. This set 
them apart not only because 
of the nature of the vehicle, 
but also because after the war 
cars of any kind were not 
easily available. Only 
families who were fairly 
wealthy had them at all. 
Frank Hawking installed a 
table in the back of the taxi, 
between the usual bench seat 
and the fold-down seats, so 



that Stephen and his siblings 
could play cards and games. 
The car and the game table 
were put to especially good 
use getting to their usual 
holiday location, a painted 
gypsy caravan and an 
enormous army tent set up in 
a field at Osmington Mills, in 
Dorset. The Hawking 
campsite was only a hundred 
yards from the beach. It was a 
rocky beach, not sand, but it 



was an interesting part of the 
coast - smuggler territory in a 
past age. 

In the post-war years it 
was not unusual for families 
to live frugally with few 
luxuries, unable to afford 
home repairs, and, out of 
generosity or financial 
constraint, house more than 
two generations under one 
roof. But the Hawkings, 
though their house in St 



Albans was larger than many 
British homes, carried 
frugality and disrepair to an 
extreme. In this three- storey, 
strangely put together 
redbrick dwelling, Frank kept 
bees in the cellar, and 
Stephen's Scottish 
grandmother lived in the attic, 
emerging regularly to play 
the piano spectacularly well 
for local folk dances. The 
house was in dire need of 



work when the Hawkings 
moved in, and it stayed that 
way. According to Stephen's 
adopted younger brother 
Edward, 'It was a very large, 
dark house ... really rather 
spooky, rather like a 
nightmare.' 2 The leaded 
stained glass at the front door 
must originally have been 
beautiful but was missing 
pieces. The front hall was lit 
only by a single bulb and its 



fine authentic William Morris 
wall covering had darkened. 
A greenhouse behind the 
rotting porch lost panes 
whenever there was a wind. 
There was no central heating, 
the carpeting was sparse, 
broken windows were not 
replaced. The books, packed 
two deep on shelves all over 
the house, added a modicum 
of insulation. Frank Hawking 
would brook no complaints. 



One had only to put on more 
clothes in winter, he insisted. 
Frank himself was often away 
on research trips to Africa 
during the coldest months. 
Stephen's sister Mary recalls 
thinking that fathers were 
'like migratory birds. They 
were there for Christmas and 
then they vanished until the 
weather got warm.'- She 
thought that fathers of her 
friends who didn't disappear 



were 'a bit odd'.- 

The house lent itself to 
imaginative escapades. 
Stephen and Mary competed 
in finding ways to get in, 
some of them so secret that 
Mary was never able to 
discover more than ten of the 
eleven that Stephen managed 
to use. As if one such house 
were not enough, Stephen had 
another imaginary one in an 
imaginary place he called 



Drane. It seemed he did not 
know where this was, only 
that it existed. His mother 
became a little frantic, so 
determined was he to take a 
bus to find it, but later, when 
they visited Kenwood House 
in Hampstead Heath, she 
heard him declare that this 
was it, the house he had seen 
in a dream.- 

'Hawkingese' was the 
name Stephen's friends gave 



the Hawking 'family dialect'. 
Frank Hawking himself had a 
stutter and Stephen and his 
siblings spoke so rapidly at 
home that they also stumbled 
over their words and invented 
their own oral shorthand.- 
That did not prevent Stephen 
from being, according to his 
mother, 'always extremely 
conversational'. He was also 
'very imaginative ... loved 
music and acting in plays', 



also 'rather lazy' but 'a self- 
educator from the start . . . like 
a bit of blotting paper, 
soaking it all up'.— Part of the 
reason for his lack of 
distinction in school was that 
he could not be bothered with 
things he already knew or 
decided he had no need to 
know. 

Stephen had a rather 
commanding nature in spite 
of being smaller than most of 



his classmates. He was well- 
organized and capable of 
getting other people 
organized. He was also 
known as something of a 
comedian. Getting knocked 
around by larger boys didn't 
bother him much, but he had 
his limits, and he could, when 
driven to it, turn rather fierce 
and daunting. His friend 
Simon Humphrey had a 
heftier build than Stephen, 



but Simon's mother recalled 
that it was Stephen, not 
Simon, who on one 
memorable occasion swung 
around with his fists clenched 
to confront the much larger 
bullies who were teasing 
them. 'That's the sort of thing 
he did - he was equal to 
anything. '— 

The eight-year-old 
Stephen's first school in St 
Albans was the High School 



for Girls, curiously named 
since its students included 
young children well below 
'high school' age, and its 
Michael House admitted 
boys. A seven-year-old 
named Jane Wilde, in a class 
somewhat younger than 
Stephen's, noticed the boy 
with 'floppy-golden-brown 
hair' as he sat 'by the wall in 
the next-door classroom',— 
but she didn't meet him. She 



would later become his wife. 

Stephen attended that 
school for only a few months, 
until Frank needed to stay in 
Africa longer than usual and 
Isobel accepted an invitation 
to take the children for four 
months to Majorca, off the 
east coast of Spain. Balmy, 
beautiful Majorca, the home 
of Isobel' s friend from her 
Oxford days, Beryl, and 
Beryl's husband, the poet 



Robert Graves, was an 
enchanting place to spend the 
winter. Education was not 
entirely neglected for there 
was a tutor for Stephen and 
the Graveses' son William.- 

Back in St Albans after 
this idyllic hiatus, Stephen 
went for one year to Radlett, 
a private school, and then did 
well enough in his tests to 
qualify for a place at the more 
selective St Albans School, 



also a private school, in the 
shadow of the Cathedral. 
Though in his first year at St 
Albans he managed to rank 
no better than an astonishing 
third from the bottom of his 
class, his teachers were 
beginning to perceive that he 
was more intelligent than he 
was demonstrating in the 
classroom. His friends 
dubbed him 'Einstein', either 
because he seemed more 



intelligent than they or 
because they thought he was 
eccentric. Probably both. His 
friend Michael Church 
remembers that he had a sort 
of 'overarching arrogance ... 
some overarching sense of 
what the world was about'. - 

'Einstein' soon rose in 
ranking to about the middle 
of the class. He even won the 
Divinity prize one year. From 
Stephen's earliest childhood, 



his father had read him stories 
from the Bible. 'He was quite 
well versed in religious 
things,' Isobel later told an 
interviewer.— The family 
often enjoyed having 
theological debates, arguing 
quite happily for and against 
the existence of God. 

Undeterred by a low class 
placing, ever since the age of 
eight or nine Stephen had 
been thinking more and more 



seriously about becoming a 
scientist. He was addicted to 
questioning how things 
worked and trying to find out. 
It seemed to him that in 
science he could find out the 
truth, not only about clocks 
and radios but also about 
everything else around him. 
His parents planned that at 
thirteen he would go to 
Westminster School. Frank 
Hawking thought his own 



advancement had suffered 
because of his parents' 
poverty and the fact that he 
had not attended a prestigious 
school. Others with less 
ability but higher social 
standing had got ahead of 
him, or so he felt. Stephen 
was to have something better. 

The Hawkings could not 
afford Westminster unless 
Stephen won a scholarship. 
Unfortunately, he was prone 



at this age to recurring bouts 
of a low fever, diagnosed as 
glandular fever, that 
sometimes was serious 
enough to keep him home 
from school in bed. As bad 
luck would have it, he was ill 
at the time of the scholarship 
examination. Frank's hopes 
were dashed and Stephen 
continued at St Albans 
School, but he believes his 
education there was at least as 



good as the one he would 
have received at Westminster. 

After the Hawkings 
adopted Edward in 1955, 
Stephen was no longer the 
only male sibling. Stephen 
accepted his new younger 
brother in good grace. He 
was, according to Stephen, 
'probably good for us. He 
was a rather difficult child, 
but one couldn't help liking 
him.' 22 



Continuing at St Albans 
School rather than heading 
off to Westminster had one 
distinct advantage. It meant 
being able to continue 
growing up in a little band of 
close friends who shared with 
Stephen such interests as the 
hazardous manufacture of 
fireworks in the dilapidated 
greenhouse and inventing 
board games of astounding 
complexity, and who relished 



long discussions on a wide 
range of subjects. Their game 
'Risk' involved railways, 
factories, manufacturing, and 
its own stock exchange, and 
took days of concentrated 
play to finish. A feudal game 
had dynasties and elaborate 
family trees. According to 
Michael Church, there was 
something that particularly 
intrigued Stephen about 
conjuring up these worlds and 



setting down the laws that 
governed them.— John 
McClenahan's father had a 
workshop where he allowed 
John and Stephen to construct 
model aeroplanes and boats, 
and Stephen later remarked 
that he liked 'to build 
working models that I could 
control ... Since I began my 
Ph.D., this need has been met 
by my research into 
cosmology. If you understand 



how the universe operates, 
you control it in a way.'- In a 
sense, Hawking 's grown-up 
models of the universe stand 
in relation to the 'real' 
universe in the same way his 
childhood model aeroplanes 
and boats stood in relation to 
real aeroplanes and boats. 
They give an agreeable, 
comforting feeling of control 
while, in actuality, 
representing no control at all. 



Stephen was fifteen when 
he learned that the universe 
was expanding. This shook 
him. ' I was sure there must be 
some mistake,' he says. ' A 
static universe seemed so 
much more natural. It could 
have existed and could 
continue to exist for ever. But 
an expanding universe would 
change with time. If it 
continued to expand, it would 
become virtually empty.'- 



That was disturbing. 

Like many other 
teenagers of their generation, 
Stephen and his friends 
became fascinated with 
extrasensory perception 
(ESP). They tried to dictate 
the throw of dice with their 
minds. However, Stephen's 
interest turned to disgust 
when he attended a lecture by 
someone who had 
investigated famous ESP 



studies at Duke University in 
the United States. The 
lecturer told his audience that 
whenever the experiments got 
results, the experimental 
techniques were faulty, and 
whenever the experimental 
techniques were not faulty, 
they got no results. Stephen 
concluded that ESP was a 
fraud. His scepticism about 
claims for psychic 
phenomena has not changed. 



To his way of thinking, 
people who believe such 
claims are stalled at the level 
where he was at the age of 
fifteen. 

Ancestor of 'Cosmos' 

Probably the best of all the 
little group's adventures and 
achievements - and one that 
captured the attention and 
admiration of the entire town 
of St Albans - was building a 



computer that they called 
LUCE (Logical Uniselector 
Computing Engine). Cobbled 
together out of recycled 
pieces of clocks and other 
mechanical and electrical 
items, including an old 
telephone switchboard, 
LUCE could perform simple 
mathematical functions. 
Unfortunately that teenage 
masterpiece no longer exists. 
Whatever remained of it was 



thrown away eventually when 
a new head of computing at 
St Albans went on a cleaning 

24 

spree. - 

The most advanced 
version of LUCE was the 
product of Stephen's and his 
friends' final years of school 
before university. They were 
having to make hard choices 
about the future. Frank 
Hawking encouraged his son 
to follow him into medicine. 



Stephen's sister Mary would 
do that, but Stephen found 
biology too imprecise to suit 
him. Biologists, he thought, 
observed and described things 
but didn't explain them on a 
fundamental level. Biology 
also involved detailed 
drawings, and he wasn't good 
at drawing. He wanted a 
subject in which he could 
look for exact answers and 
get to the root of things. If 



he'd known about molecular 
biology, his career might 
have been very different. At 
fourteen, particularly inspired 
by a teacher named Mr Tahta, 
he had decided that what he 
wanted to do was 
'mathematics, more 
mathematics, and physics'. 

Stephen's father insisted 
this was impractical. What 
jobs were there for 
mathematicians other than 



teaching? Moreover he 
wanted Stephen to attend his 
own college, University 
College, Oxford, and at 
'Univ' one could not read 
mathematics. Stephen 
followed his father's advice 
and began boning up on 
chemistry, physics and only a 
little maths, in preparation for 
entrance to Oxford. He would 
apply to Univ to study mainly 
physics and chemistry. 



In 1959, during Stephen's 
last year before leaving home 
for university, his mother 
Isobel and the three younger 
children accompanied Frank 
when he journeyed to India 
for an unusually lengthy 
research project. Stephen 
stayed in St Albans and lived 
for the year with the family of 
his friend Simon Humphrey. 
He continued to spend a great 
deal of time improving 



LUCE, though Dr Humphrey 
interrupted regularly to insist 
he write letters to his family - 
something Stephen on his 
own would have happily 
neglected. But the main task 
of that year had to be 
studying for scholarship 
examinations coming up in 
March. It was essential that 
Stephen perform extremely 
well in these examinations if 
there was to be even an 



outside chance of Oxford's 
accepting him. 

Students who rank no 
higher than halfway up in 
their school class seldom get 
into Oxford unless someone 
pulls strings behind the 
scenes. Stephen's lacklustre 
performance in school gave 
Frank Hawking plenty of 
cause to think he had better 
begin pulling strings. 
Stephen's headmaster at St 



Albans also had his doubts 
about Stephen's chances of 
acceptance and a scholarship, 
and he suggested Stephen 
might wait another year. He 
was young to be applying to 
university. The two other 
boys planning to take the 
exams with him were a year 
older. However, both 
headmaster and father had 
underestimated Stephen ' s 
intelligence and knowledge, 



and his capacity to rise to a 
challenge. He achieved nearly 
perfect marks in the physics 
section of the entrance 
examinations. His interview 
at Oxford with the Master of 
University College and the 
physics tutor, Dr Robert 
Berman, went so well there 
was no question but that he 
would be accepted to read 
physics and be given a 
scholarship. A triumphant 



Stephen joined his family in 
India for the end of their stay. 

Not a Grey Man 

In October 1959, aged 
seventeen, Hawking went up 
to Oxford to enter University 
College, his father's college. 
'Univ' is in the heart of 
Oxford, on the High Street. 
Founded in 1249, it is the 
oldest of the many colleges 
that together make up the 



University. Stephen would 
study natural science, with an 
emphasis on physics. By this 
time he had come to consider 
mathematics not as a subject 
to be studied for itself but as a 
tool for doing physics and 
learning how the universe 
behaves. He would later 
regret that he had not exerted 
more effort mastering that 
tool. 

Oxford's architecture, like 



Cambridge's, is a magnificent 
hodge-podge of every style 
since the Middle Ages. Its 
intellectual and social 
traditions predate even its 
buildings and, like those of 
any great university, are a 
mix of authentic intellectual 
brilliance, pretentious fakery, 
innocent tomfoolery and true 
decadence. For a young man 
interested in any of these, 
Stephen's new environment 



had much to offer. 
Nevertheless, for about a year 
and a half, he was lonely and 
bored. Many students in his 
year were considerably older 
than he, not only because he 
had sat his examinations early 
but because others had taken 
time off for national service. 
He was not inspired to relieve 
his boredom by exerting 
himself academically. He had 
discovered he could get by 



better than most by doing 
virtually no studying at all. 

Contrary to their 
reputation, Oxford tutorials 
are often not one-to-one but 
two or three students with one 
tutor. A young man named 
Gordon Berry became 
Hawking 's tutorial partner. 
They were two of only four 
physics students who entered 
Univ that Michaelmas 
(autumn) term of 1959. This 



small group of newcomers - 
Berry, Hawking, Richard 
Bryan and Derek Powney - 
spent most of their time 
together, somewhat isolated 
from the rest of the College. 

It wasn't until he was 
halfway through his second 
year that Stephen began 
enjoying Oxford. When 
Robert Berman describes 
him, it's difficult to believe 
he's speaking of the same 



Stephen Hawking who 
seemed so ordinary a few 
years earlier and so bored the 
previous year. '[H]e did, I 
think, positively make an 
effort to sort of come down to 
[the other students'] level and 
you know, be one of the boys. 
If you didn't know about his 
physics and to some extent 
his mathematical ability, he 
wouldn't have told you ... He 
was very popular.'- Others 



who remember Stephen in his 
second and third years at 
Oxford describe him as 
lively, buoyant and adaptable. 
He wore his hair long, was 
famous for his wit, and liked 
classical music and science 
fiction. 

The attitude among most 
Oxford students in those 
days, Hawking remembers, 
was 'very antiwork': 'You 
were supposed either to be 



brilliant without effort, or to 
accept your limitations and 
get a fourth-class degree. To 
work hard to get a better class 
of degree was regarded as the 
mark of a grey man, the worst 
epithet in the Oxford 
vocabulary. ' Stephen' s 

freewheeling, independent 
spirit and casual attitude 
towards his studies fitted 
right in. In a typical incident 
one day in a tutorial, after 



reading a solution he had 
worked out, he crumpled up 
the paper disdainfully and 
propelled it across the room 
into the wastepaper basket. 

The physics curriculum, 
at least for someone with 
Hawking's abilities, could be 
navigated successfully 
without rising above this 
blase approach. Hawking 
described it as 'ridiculously 
easy. You could get through 



without going to any lectures, 
just by going to one or two 
tutorials a week. You didn't 
need to remember many facts, 
just a few equations.'- You 
could also, it seems, get 
through without spending 
very much time doing 
experiments in the laboratory. 
Gordon and he found ways to 
use shortcuts in taking data 
and fake parts of the 
experiments. 'We just didn't 



apply ourselves,' remembers 
Berry. 'And Steve was right 
down there in not applying 
himself. '- 

Derek Powney tells the 
story of the four of them 
receiving an assignment 
having to do with electricity 
and magnetism. There were 
thirteen questions, and their 
tutor, Dr Berman, told them 
to finish as many as they 
could in the week before the 



next tutorial. At the end of the 
week Richard Bryan and 
Derek had managed to solve 
one and a half of the 
problems; Gordon only one. 
Stephen had not yet begun. 
On the day of the tutorial 
Stephen missed three 
morning lectures in order to 
work on the questions, and 
his friends thought he was 
about to get his come- 
uppance. His bleak 



announcement when he 
joined them at noon was that 
he had been able to solve 
only ten. At first they thought 
he was joking, until they 
realized he had done ten. 
Derek's comment was that 
this was the moment 
Stephen's friends recognized 
'that it was not just that we 
weren't in the same street, we 
weren't on the same planet'.— 
'Even in Oxford, we must all 



have been remarkably stupid 
by his standards. '— 

His friends were not the 
only ones who sometimes 
found his intelligence 
impressive. Dr Berman and 
other dons were also 
beginning to recognize that 
Hawking had a brilliant mind, 
'completely different from his 
contemporaries'. 
'Undergraduate physics was 
simply not a challenge for 



him. He did very little work, 
really, because anything that 
was do-able he could do. It 
was only necessary for him to 
know something could be 
done, and he could do it 
without looking to see how 
other people did it. Whether 
he had any books I don't 
know, but he didn't have very 
many, and he didn't take 
notes.'— 'I'm not conceited 
enough to think that I ever 



taught him anything.' - 
Another tutor called him the 
kind of student who liked 
finding mistakes in the 
textbooks better than working 
out the problems. 

The Oxford physics 
course was scheduled in a 
way that made it easy not to 
see much urgent need for 
work. It was a three-year 
course with no exams until 
the end of the third year. 



Hawking calculates he spent 
on the average about one hour 
per day studying: about one 
thousand hours in three years. 
'I'm not proud of this lack of 
work,' he says. 'I'm just 
describing my attitude at the 
time, which I shared with 
most of my fellow students: 
an attitude of complete 
boredom and feeling that 
nothing was worth making an 
effort for. One result of my 



illness has been to change all 
that: when you are faced with 
the possibility of an early 
death, it makes you realize 
that life is worth living, and 
that there are lots of things 
you want to do.' 

One major explanation 
why Stephen's spirits 
improved dramatically in the 
middle of his second year was 
that he and Gordon Berry 
joined the college Boat Club. 



Neither of them was a hefty 
hunk of the sort who make 
the best rowers. But both 
were light, wiry, intelligent 
and quick, with strong, 
commanding voices, and 
these are the attributes that 
college boat clubs look for 
when recruiting a coxswain 
(cox) - the person who sits 
looking forward, facing the 
line of four or eight rowers, 
and steers the boat with 



handles attached to the 
rudder. The position of cox is 
definitely a position of 
control, something that 
Hawking has said appealed to 
him with model boats, 
aeroplanes and universes - a 
man of slight build 
commanding eight muscle- 
men. 

Stephen exerted himself 
far more on the river, rowing 
and coxing for Univ, than he 



did at his studies. One sure 
way to be part of the 'in' 
crowd at Oxford was to be a 
member of your college 
rowing team. If intense 
boredom and a feeling that 
nothing was worth making an 
effort for were the prevailing 
attitudes elsewhere, all that 
changed on the river. Rowers, 
coxes and coaches regularly 
assembled at the boathouse at 
dawn, even when there was a 



crust of ice on the river, to 
perform arduous calisthenics 
and lift the racing shell into 
the water. The merciless 
practice went on in all 
weather, up and down the 
river, coaches bicycling along 
the towpath exhorting their 
crews. On race days emotions 
ran high and crowds of rowdy 
well-wishers sprinted along 
the banks of the river to keep 
up with their college boats. 



There were foggy race days 
when boats appeared and 
vanished like ghosts, and 
drenching race days when 
water filled the bottom of the 
boat. Boat club dinners in 
formal dress in the college 
hall lasted late and ended in 
battles of wine- soaked linen 
napkins. 

All of it added up to a 
stupendous feeling of 
physical well-being, 



camaraderie, all-stops-out 
effort, and of living college 
life to the hilt. Stephen 
became a popular member of 
the boating crowd. At the 
level of intercollege 
competition he did well. He'd 
never before been good at a 
sport, and this was an 
exhilarating change. The 
College Boatsman of that era, 
Norman Dix, remembered 
him as an 'adventurous type; 



you never knew quite what he 
was going to do'.— Broken 
oars and damaged boats were 
not uncommon as Stephen 
steered tight corners and 
attempted to take advantage 
of narrow manoeuvring 
opportunities that other coxes 
avoided. 

At the end of the third 
year, however, examinations 
suddenly loomed larger than 
any boat race. Hawking 



almost floundered. He'd 
settled on theoretical physics 
as his speciality. That meant a 
choice between two areas for 
graduate work: cosmology, 
the study of the very large; or 
elementary particles, the 
study of the very small. 
Hawking chose cosmology. 
'It just seemed that 
cosmology was more 
exciting, because it really did 
seem to involve the big 



question: Where did the 
universe come from?'— Fred 
Hoyle, the most distinguished 
British astronomer of his 
time, was at Cambridge. 
Stephen had become 
particularly enthusiastic about 
the idea of working with 
Hoyle when he took a 
summer course with one of 
Hoyle' s most outstanding 
graduate students, Jayant 
Narlikar. Stephen applied to 



do Ph.D. research at 
Cambridge and was accepted 
with the condition that he get 
a First from Oxford. 

One thousand hours of 
study was meagre preparation 
for getting a First. However, 
an Oxford examination offers 
a choice from many questions 
and problems. Stephen was 
confident he could get 
through successfully by doing 
problems in theoretical 



physics and avoiding any 
questions that required 
knowledge of facts. As the 
examination day approached, 
his confidence faltered. He 
decided, as a fail-safe, to take 
the Civil Service exams and 
apply for a job with the 
Ministry of Works. 

The night before his 
Oxford examinations Stephen 
was too nervous to sleep. The 
examination went poorly. He 



was to take the Civil Service 
exams the next morning, but 
he overslept and missed them. 
Now everything hung on his 
Oxford results. 

As Stephen and his 
friends waited on tenterhooks 
for their results to be posted, 
only Gordon was confident 
he had done well in his 
examinations - well enough 
for a First, he believed. 
Gordon was wrong. He and 



Derek received Seconds, 
Richard a disappointing 
Third. Stephen ended up 
disastrously on the borderline 
between a First and a Second. 

Faced with a borderline 
result, the examiners 
summoned Hawking for a 
personal interview, a 'viva'. 
They questioned him about 
his plans. In spite of the 
tenseness of the situation, 
with his future hanging in the 



balance, Stephen managed to 
come up with the kind of 
remark for which he was 
famous among his friends: 'If 
I get a First, I shall go to 
Cambridge. If I receive a 
Second, I will remain at 
Oxford. So I expect that you 
will give me a First.' He got 
his First. Dr Berman said of 
the examiners: 'They were 
intelligent enough to realize 
they were talking to someone 



far cleverer than most of 
themselves.'— 

That triumph 
notwithstanding, all was not 
well. Hawking 's adventures 
as a cox, his popularity, and 
his angst about his exams had 
pushed into the background a 
problem that he had first 
begun to notice that year and 
that refused to go away. ' I 
seemed to be getting more 
clumsy, and I fell over once 



or twice for no apparent 
reason,'— he remembers. The 
problem had even invaded his 
halcyon existence on the river 
when he began to have 
difficulty sculling (rowing a 
one-man boat). During his 
final Oxford term, he tumbled 
down the stairs and landed on 
his head. His friends spent 
several hours helping him 
overcome a temporary loss of 
short- and long-term memory, 



insisted he go to a doctor to 
make sure no serious damage 
had been done, and 
encouraged him to take a 
Mensa intelligence test to 
prove to them and to himself 
that his mind was not 
affected. All seemed well, but 
they found it difficult to 
believe that his fall had been 
a simple accident. 

There was indeed 
something amiss, though not 



as a result of his tumble . . . 
and not with his mind. That 
summer, on a trip he and a 
friend took to Persia (now 
Iran), he became seriously ill, 
probably from a tourist 
stomach problem or a 
reaction to the vaccines 
required for the trip.- It was a 
harrowing journey in other 
ways, more harrowing for his 
family back home than for 
Stephen. They lost touch with 



him for three weeks, during 
which time there was a 
serious earthquake in the area 
where he was travelling. 
Stephen, as it turned out, had 
been so ill and riding on such 
a bumpy bus that he didn't 
notice the earthquake at all. 
He finally got back home, 
depleted and unwell. Later 
there would be speculation 
about whether a non-sterile 
smallpox vaccination prior to 



the trip had caused his illness 
in Persia and also his ALS, 
but the latter had, in fact, 
begun earlier. Nevertheless, 
because of his illness in 
Persia and the increasingly 
troubling symptoms he was 
experiencing, Stephen arrived 
at Cambridge a more 
unsettled and weaker twenty- 
year-old than he had been at 
Oxford the previous spring. 
He moved into Trinity Hall 



for the Michaelmas term in 
the autumn of 1962. 

During the summer before 
Stephen left for Cambridge, 
Jane Wilde saw him while 
she was out walking with her 
friends in St Albans. He was 
a 'young man with an 
awkward gait, his head down, 
his face shielded from the 
world under an unruly mass 
of straight brown hair ... 
immersed in his own 



thoughts, looking neither 
right nor left ... lolloping 
along in the opposite 
direction'.- Jane's friend 
Diana King, sister of 
Stephen's friend Basil King, 
astonished her friends by 
telling them that she had gone 
out with him. 'He's strange 
but very clever. He took me 
to the theatre once. He goes 
on Ban the Bomb marches.'—

The realization that I 

had an incurable 
disease, that was likely 
to kill me in a few 
years, was a bit of a 
shock' 



HAWKING' S FIRST YEAR at 

Cambridge was largely a 
disaster. Fred Hoyle already 
had his full quota of graduate 
students and Stephen was 
assigned Denis Sciama 
instead. Sciama was a lesser 
name in physics than Hoyle - 
in fact, Stephen had never 
heard of him - but others 
knew him to be a fine mentor 
who cared deeply about his 
students. He also was far 



more available in Cambridge 
than Hoyle, who was an 
international figure and spent 
much of his time at 
observatories in other parts of 
the world. Sciama and Hoyle 
both favoured the 'Steady 
State' theory of the universe. 
Hoyle, with Hermann Bondi 
and Tom Gold, had fathered 
that theory. 

The Steady State theory 
recognized the expansion of 



the universe but, unlike the 
Big Bang theory, did not 
require the universe to have a 
beginning in time. The 
proposal was that as the 
universe expands, with 
galaxies moving apart from 
one another, new matter 
appears to fill the 
increasingly large gaps 
among them, eventually 
forming new stars and 
galaxies. At any moment in 



its history and future, the 
universe looks pretty much 
the same as it does at any 
other time. The Steady State 
was destined to lose the 
contest with the Big Bang 
theory, but for a while it 
seemed a brilliantly viable 
competitor. 

For someone with 
Hawking ' s slipshod 
mathematics background, 
general relativity was rough 



going, and he soon sorely 
regretted allowing his father 
to steer him away from maths 
at Oxford. Sciama suggested 
that he might concentrate on 
astrophysics, but Stephen had 
firmly set his sights on 
general relativity and 
cosmology. Keeping his head 
barely above water, he 
undertook a quick, arduous 
self-education. At King's 
College London, Hermann 



Bondi had started a course in 
general relativity. Stephen, 
along with other Cambridge 
graduate students, travelled 
there regularly for lectures. 

Relativity and cosmology 
were risky choices even for 
those sufficiently well 
prepared in mathematics. The 
scientific community 
regarded cosmology with 
some suspicion and 
disfavour. As Hawking would 



later recall, 'Cosmology used 
to be considered a 
pseudoscience and the 
preserve of physicists who 
might have done useful work 
in their earlier years, but who 
had gone mystic in their 
dotage.' 1 It was highly 
speculative, with in sufficient 
observational data to curb or 
shape speculation.- Sciama 
himself, just two years before 
Hawking met him, wrote that 



cosmology was 'a highly 
controversial subject, which 
contains little or no agreed 
body of doctrine'. 2 

Hawking was aware of 
these difficulties, but the 
challenge of working at the 
frontiers and venturing into 
unexplored territory was 
irresistible. Cosmology and 
general relativity were 
'neglected fields that were 
ripe for development at that 



time. Unlike elementary 
particles, there was a well- 
defined theory, Einstein's 
general theory of relativity, 
thought to be impossibly 
difficult. People were so 
pleased to find any solution to 
[Einstein's] field equations; 
they didn't ask what physical 
significance, if any, it had. '- 

Einstein's general theory 
of relativity was indeed, as 
Hawking pointed out, a well- 



defined theory in which 
gravity is explained as the 
warping of spacetime, but 
Sciama had been right about 
cosmology. The battle still 
raged about which theory 
could correctly describe the 
history of the universe - the 
Big Bang theory or the 
Steady State theory. Had the 
universe had a beginning or 
not? In the twenty-first 
century, it seems incredible 



that when Hawking came up 
to Cambridge as a graduate 
student in 1962, that contest 
had not yet by any means 
been settled. 

Hawking' s failure to get 
Hoyle as his supervisor and 
his mathematical deficiencies 
were setbacks, but no more 
than typical for a first-year 
graduate student. While he 
struggled to catch up on 
general relativity and find a 



way through the 

mathematical maze needed to 
understand it, a far more 
unusual and merciless 
problem was overtaking him 
in the autumn of 1962, 
threatening to make all this 
effort meaningless. The 
clumsiness he had noticed 
during his third year at 
Oxford kept getting worse. 
That first autumn in 
Cambridge, he had trouble 



tying his shoes and 
sometimes had a problem 
talking. His speech became 
slurred, enough so that those 
who met him for the first time 
assumed he had a slight 
speech impediment. 

When he went home to St 
Albans for Christmas after his 
first term in Cambridge, 
Stephen's physical problems 
were too obvious to conceal 
from his parents. Frank 



Hawking took his son to the 
family doctor. That doctor 
referred them to a specialist. 
They made an appointment 
for after the holidays. 

Shortly after his twenty- 
first birthday in January, 
Hawking found himself not 
heading back to Cambridge 
for the Lent term but in St 
Bartholomew's Hospital in 
London for tests. Perhaps it 
made the situation a little less 



daunting that his sister Mary, 
preparing to follow their 
father into medicine, was in 
training at 'Bart's'. Stephen 
refused the private hospital 
room his parents had wanted 
for him, because of his 
'socialist principles'. In 
hospital, specialists took a 
muscle sample from his arm, 
stuck electrodes into him, and 
injected radio-opaque fluid 
into his spine and watched it 



going up and down with X- 
rays while they tilted the bed 
on which he lay. After two 
weeks they released him, 
telling him vaguely that what 
he had wasn't a 'typical case' 
and that it wasn't multiple 
sclerosis. The doctors 
suggested he go back to 
Cambridge and get on with 
his work. 'I gathered,' 
Hawking remembers, 'that 
they expected it to continue to 



get worse, and that there was 
nothing they could do, except 
give me vitamins. I could see 
that they didn't expect them 
to have much effect. I didn't 
feel like asking for more 
details, because they were 
obviously bad.' 

Isobel Hawking did not 
immediately learn how 
seriously ill her son was, 
until, out ice skating with her, 
he fell and couldn't get up. 



Finally off the ice, she 
bundled him into a cafe and 
pressured him to talk about 
the physical difficulties he 
was having and what the 
doctors were saying. She 
insisted on conferring with 
his doctor herself, and was 
given the same devastating 
news.- 

Hawking had contracted a 
rare disease for which there is 
no known cure, amyotrophic 



lateral sclerosis (ALS), 
known in Britain as motor 
neurone disease, in America 
as Lou Gehrig's disease. It 
causes a gradual 

disintegration of the nerve 
cells in the spinal cord and 
brain that regulate voluntary 
muscle activity. The first 
symptoms are usually 
weakness and twitching of 
the hands, and perhaps 
slurred speech and difficulty 



in swallowing. As nerve cells 
disintegrate, the muscles they 
control atrophy. Eventually 
this happens to every 
voluntary muscle of the body. 
Movement becomes 
impossible. Speech and all 
other means of 

communication are lost. 
Though Hawking is not the 
only patient to have survived 
for several decades, death 
almost always occurs within 



two or three years as a result 
of pneumonia or suffocation 
when the respiratory muscles 
fail. The disease does not 
affect involuntary muscles of 
the heart, muscles of waste 
elimination or the sexual 
organs, and the brain remains 
completely lucid to the end. 
To some this seems an 
advantage, to others a horror. 
Patients in the final stages of 
the disease are often given 



morphine, not for pain - there 
is none - but for panic and 
depression. 

For Hawking everything 
had changed. With typical 
understatement, he describes 
his reaction: 'The realization 
that I had an incurable 
disease, that was likely to kill 
me in a few years, was a bit 
of a shock. How could 
something like that happen to 
me? Why should I be cut off 



like this? However, while I 
had been in hospital, I had 
seen a boy I vaguely knew 
die of leukaemia in the bed 
opposite me. It had not been a 
pretty sight. Clearly there 
were people who were worse 
off than I. At least, my 
condition didn't make me feel 
sick. Whenever I feel inclined 
to be sorry for myself, I 
remember that boy. ' 

Nevertheless, at first 



Hawking went into a deep 
depression. He didn't know 
what he ought to do, what 
was going to happen to him, 
how quickly he would get 
worse, or what it would be 
like. His doctors had told him 
to continue his Ph.D. 
research, but that had already 
been going poorly. This fact 
was almost as depressing to 
him as his illness. It seemed 
pointless to try to continue 



working towards a doctorate 
he wouldn't live to receive, 
nothing but a foolish device 
for keeping his mind 
preoccupied while his body 
was dying. He holed up 
miserably in his college 
rooms at Trinity Hall, but he 
insists: 'Reports in magazine 
articles that I drank heavily 
are an exaggeration. I felt 
somewhat of a tragic 
character. I took to listening 



to Wagner. 

'My dreams at that time 
were rather disturbed,' he 
remembers. 'Before my 
condition had been 
diagnosed, I had been very 
bored with life. There had not 
seemed to be anything worth 
doing. But shortly after I 
came out of hospital, I dreamt 
that I was going to be 
executed. I suddenly realized 
that there were a lot of 



worthwhile things I could do, 
if I were reprieved. Another 
dream that I had several times 
was that I would sacrifice my 
life to save others. After all, if 
I were going to die anyway, it 
might as well do some good. ' 

Frank Hawking took 
advantage of all the 
connections his stature in the 
medical profession made 
available to him. He 
contacted experts in every 



possibly related disease, but 
all was in vain. Hawking' s 
doctors hoped his condition 
would stabilize, but the 
disease progressed rapidly. 
They soon informed him that 
he did indeed have only about 
two years to live. At that 
point his father appealed to 
Denis Sciama to help Stephen 
finish his dissertation early. 
Sciama, knowing Hawking' s 
potential and unwilling to let 



him compromise even if he 
was dying, turned the request 
down. 

Two years passed. The 
progression of the disease 
slowed. 'I didn't die. In fact, 
although there was a cloud 
hanging over my future, I 
found to my surprise that I 
was enjoying life in the 
present more than before.' He 
had to use a cane, but his 
condition wasn't all that bad. 



Total disability and death, 
though still a not-too-distant 
certainty, were postponed. 
Sciama suggested that since 
he was going to live a while 
longer, he ought to finish his 
thesis. Hawking had his 
reprieve, a precarious and 
temporary one, but life was 
precious and full of 
worthwhile things. 

In January 1963, just 
before Hawking entered the 



hospital for tests, Basil King 
and his sister Diana had 
hosted a New Year's party in 
St Albans. There, Hawking 
had met Diana's friend Jane 
Wilde,- who was just 
finishing at St Albans High 
School and had been accepted 
to study languages the next 
autumn at Westfield College 
in the University of London. 
Jane later described Stephen 
as she caught sight of him at 



that party - 'slight of frame, 
leaning against the wall in a 
corner with his back to the 
light, gesticulating with long 
thin fingers as he spoke - his 
hair falling across his face 
over his glasses - and 
wearing a dusty black-velvet 
jacket and a red- velvet bow 
tie.' 2 Embroidering somewhat 
on the story of his viva at 
Oxford (the oral exam that 
finally won him his First), he 



regaled her and a friend of his 
from Oxford with the story 
that he had tempted the 
examiners to give him a First 
and let him go to Cambridge 
by giving them the 
opportunity to send him, like 
a Trojan horse, into the rival 
university.- To Jane this 
dishevelled graduate student 
seemed terribly intelligent, 
eccentric and rather arrogant. 
But he was interesting, and 



she liked his self-mocking 
wit. He said he was studying 
cosmology. She didn't know 
what that meant. 

Stephen and Jane 
exchanged names and 
addresses at the party, and a 
few days later Jane received 
an invitation to a birthday 
celebration - his twenty-first 
- on 8 January. The party was 
Jane's first experience of the 
eccentric Hawking home at 



14 Hillside Road, St Albans. 
Though she recognized most 
of the family as familiar faces 
in St Albans, she felt 
painfully unsophisticated 
among them and their friends, 
and she spent most of the 
evening in a corner near the 
fire, trying to stay warm in 
the icy cold house, holding 
Stephen's younger brother 
Edward on her lap. The 
evening cannot have been a 



total success for Stephen 
either. His physical problems 
were becoming impossible to 
conceal. He had trouble 
pouring the drinks. 

About a month later, Jane 
overheard Diana King and a 
friend discuss the news that 
Stephen had been diagnosed 
with 'some terrible, 
paralysing incurable disease 
a bit like multiple 
sclerosis, but it's not multiple 



sclerosis and they reckon he's 
probably only got a couple of 
years to live'.- Diana's 
brother Basil had been to visit 
him in the hospital. 

It came as a surprise when 
Jane encountered Stephen a 
week later on the railway 
platform in St Albans, 
looking much as he had 
before but more 

conventionally dressed and 
with a neater haircut. They 



were both waiting for the 
train to London. On the 
journey, they sat together and 
talked. When Jane mentioned 
that she had been sorry to 
hear about his hospital stay, 
Stephen wrinkled his nose 
and said nothing.- She 
dropped the subject. He asked 
her whether she would like to 
go to the theatre with him 
some weekend when he was 
home from Cambridge. She 



said she would. 

Their first date was for 
dinner and the theatre in 
London. The evening turned 
out to be so expensive that 
when they had boarded the 
bus back towards the railway 
station, Stephen realized that 
he had run out of funds. 
There were no ATMs in those 
days. After treating this 
young lady to a truly lavish 
first date, he had to ask her 



whether she could pay the bus 
fare. Rummaging around in 
her handbag, Jane discovered 
that her purse was not there, 
and so began their first 
adventure together. 

Scuttling off the bus 
before anyone could ask for 
their fare, Jane and Stephen 
returned to the darkened, shut 
Old Vic theatre and found a 
way in by the stage door. 
Jane's purse was under the 



seat where it had fallen and 
all seemed to be turning out 
well when the lights went out 
completely. Stephen took her 
hand, and they groped their 
way back on to the stage and 
across it in total darkness, and 
out of the stage door again, 
Jane following Stephen's sure 
lead 'with silent 

admiration '.- 

Stephen was definitely 
not the pizza-and-a-movie 



type of man, for his next 
invitation was to the Trinity 
Hall May Ball. Dinner and 
the theatre in London and a 
Cambridge May Ball were 
certainly among the most 
seriously splendid dates a girl 
might hope for. 

When Stephen arrived in 
June— to take Jane to 
Cambridge, the deterioration 
of his physical condition 
shocked her. She wondered 



whether this 'slight, frail, 
limping figure who appeared 
to use the steering wheel to 
hoist himself up to see over 
the dashboard'- was capable 
of driving the car to 
Cambridge. The hazards of 
the journey, however, 
stemmed not from Stephen's 
disability but from the 
recklessness and speed of his 
driving. They arrived with 
Jane vowing to herself to take 



the train home rather than 
repeat this experience. - 

Though Trinity Hall is 
small compared with other 
Cambridge colleges like 
Trinity and St John's, its May 
Ball proved to be the magical 
experience a May Ball at its 
best should be. The lawns and 
flower beds, falling away 
towards the river and the 
meadows of the Backs 
beyond, were romantically lit, 



and everyone in formal attire 
looked remarkably better than 
usual. There was music to 
suit all tastes, in different 
parts of the college. A string 
quartet in an elegantly 
panelled room. A cabaret in 
the Hall. A jazz band. A 
Jamaican steel band. 
Champagne was served from 
a bathtub, and there was a 
lavish buffet. The festivities 
continued until dawn and 



breakfast, and the next day 
included a punt on the river. 
Jane was at first mystified but 
then impressed by the ability 
of Hawking' s friends to argue 
quite nastily with him one 
minute on some intellectual 
subject and then, the next, 
treat him with extraordinary 
gentleness and care for his 
weakened physical condition. 
When it was all over, 
Stephen, to Jane's chagrin, 



would not hear of her taking 
the train back rather than 
driving with him. She arrived 
home so flustered and 
disgusted with his driving 
that she got out of the car, left 
him at the kerb and stalked 
into the house. At her 
mother's insistence she went 
back to invite him in for tea. 
In spite of the extravagant 
date invitations, this was no 
romance yet, though 



Hawking thought she was 'a 
very nice girl',- and it was at 
about this time that Derek 
Powney became puzzled 
about his old friend's sudden 
interest in John Donne's 
elegies, some of the most 
beautiful and explicit love 
poems ever written.— 

After seeing Stephen on a 
few more occasions with his 
family and hers, Jane set off 
for a summer in Spain, a 



requirement for her language 
degree from Westfield 
College. When she returned, 
Stephen had departed for 
Cambridge again, and Jane 
soon left St Albans herself to 
live in London and begin her 
studies. It wasn't until 
November that she heard 
from him. He was coming to 
London for a dental 
appointment and invited her 
to go with him to the Wallace 



Collection (a famous display 
of art, furniture, porcelain, 
arms and armour), to dinner 
and to Wagner's opera The 
Flying Dutchman. On this 
date, Stephen stumbled and 
fell in the middle of Lower 
Regent Street. Jane dragged 
him to his feet. She noticed 
that as his walking became 
increasingly unsteady, his 
opinions became stronger and 
more defiant. On this 



occasion, not long after the 
assassination of US President 
Kennedy, he expressed 
disapproval of Kennedy's 
handling of the Cuban 
Missile Crisis. - 

That winter, Stephen 
came frequently to London 
for seminars and dental 
appointments and seemed to 
have a steady supply of opera 
tickets. Jane also travelled 
often to Cambridge to see 



him at the weekends. By this 
time she was definitely 'in 
love with Stephen, with his 
wicked sense of humour. The 
light in his eyes was 
magnetic',- but she refused 
to have a short-term affair 
with him. Short term was 
unfortunately all he could 
foresee, and their weekends 
were not happy. Jane returned 
to London many times in 
tears. 



One problem was that, 
voluble as Stephen could be 
on most matters, he was not 
willing to discuss his illness 
or share his feelings about it. 
Though this troubled Jane at 
the time, she didn't put 
pressure on him. It was only 
later that she realized they 
had set a precedent of non- 
communication that would 
serve them ill in the future.— 
One day in late winter she 



met him after he had an 
appointment with his Harley 
Street consultant. When she 
asked him how it had gone, 
'he grimaced' and told her the 
doctor had told him 'not to 
bother to come back, because 
there's nothing he can do'.- 
End of conversation. 

Jane's first year at 
Westfield was a period of 
spiritual questioning. It would 
not have been difficult to be 



won over to agnosticism or 
even atheism by this 
charismatic, intellectually 
brilliant young man, beside 
whom she still felt a little like 
an awkward teenager. But 
Jane stuck with the faith in 
God ingrained in her from 
childhood by her mother and 
also to the belief that good 
can come out of any disaster. 
She concluded that she would 
have to 'maintain sufficient 



faith for the two of us if any 
good were to come of our sad 
plight'.- Stephen, though he 
never shared her faith, 
admired her energy and her 
optimism and gradually 
began to find them 
contagious. 

Not everything was an 
upward curve. In spite of 
their closeness in the winter, 
when Jane spent a term in 
Spain that spring of 1964, her 



letters to Stephen went 
unanswered. During a short 
interval in St Albans before 
she departed again to spend 
the summer touring Europe 
with her family, Jane found 
Stephen depressed and 
cynical, playing Wagner at 
high volume, not bothering, 
for a change, to hide his sense 
of futility and frustration, and 
seemingly determined to do 
all he could to alienate her. 



As she would later tell an 
interviewer, 'he was really in 
quite a pathetic state. I think 
he'd lost the will to live. He 
was very confused.'- They 
were apart for most of the 
summer. Stephen went with 
his sister Philippa to Bayreuth 
for Wagner's Ring cycle and, 
from there, on a journey 
behind the Iron Curtain to 
Prague. 

Near the end of her 



family's European travels, 
Jane found a postcard from 
Stephen waiting for her at 
their hotel in Venice. It was 
marvel enough that there 
should be one at all, but it 
was cheerful and informative. 
The picture was of the castle- 
fortress that towers over 
Salzburg, in Austria, and 
Stephen's message exclaimed 
about the Salzburg Festival, 
Bayreuth and Prague. 



Clutching that postcard, Jane 
explored Venice in a 
romantic haze, hardly able to 
contain her eagerness to get 
back to England and Stephen. 

When Jane got home to St 
Albans, she found Stephen in 
much better spirits than he 
had been earlier in the 
summer, in spite of having 
knocked out his front teeth in 
a fall while travelling on a 
train in Germany - a sad 



shame after all that dental 
work that had brought him to 
London. His physical 
condition appeared to have 
stabilized. He was daring to 
look ahead. 

On a wet Cambridge 
autumn evening at the 
beginning of the Michaelmas 
term, Stephen proposed 
marriage and Jane agreed. ' I 
wanted to find some purpose 
to my existence,' she says, 



'and I suppose I found it in 
the idea of looking after him. 
But we were in love, we got 
married, there didn't seem 
much choice in the matter. I 
just decided what I was going 
to do, and I did it.'— They had 
come to realize, 'that together 
we could make something 
worthwhile of our lives '.- 

For Stephen the 
engagement made 'all the 
difference'. 'The engagement 



changed my life. It gave me 
something to live for. It made 
me determined to live. 
Without the help that Jane has 
given I would not have been 
able to carry on, nor have had 
the will to do so.' 

Jane's father gave his 
consent to the marriage on the 
condition that she complete 
her college education and that 
unreasonable demands not be 
placed on her. Frank 



Hawking suggested that 
because of his son's brief life 
expectancy they have 
children as soon as possible. 
As a medical man, he assured 
her that Stephen's condition 
was not hereditary.- 

One obstacle to their 
marriage had to be dealt with 
immediately. Westfield 
College did not permit its 
undergraduates to marry. An 
exception was made on the 



grounds that Jane's betrothed 
husband might not live until 
their wedding date if it were 
postponed. Jane was, 
however, required to move 
out of the college into private 
accommodation in London. 
There she would spend her 
week days, returning to 
Cambridge and Stephen at 
weekends.- Stephen also had 
to move out of college 
housing and find new 



lodgings. 

Hawking ' s natural 
buoyancy returned. He found 
an ingenious way of phoning 
London for only the cost of a 
local Cambridge call, and in 
long telephone conversations 
'illness assumed the 
proportions of a minor 
background irritant as we 
talked about job prospects, 
housing, wedding 
arrangements, and our first 



trip to the United States ... 
due to start just ten days after 
the wedding'.- Hawking was 
at last making progress with 
his studies. He decided to 
count himself supremely 
lucky that his illness would 
never touch his mind, no 
matter how it might paralyse 
his body. Work in theoretical 
physics was going to take 
place almost entirely in his 
mind. It was one of the few 



careers he might have chosen 
in which physical disability 
wouldn't be a serious 
handicap. 

This attitude sounds 
courageous, but it 
embarrasses Stephen 
Hawking to hear himself 
described that way. It would 
have been courageous and 
required tremendous 
willpower, he thinks, to have 
chosen such a difficult course 



deliberately, but that wasn't 
how it happened. He simply 
did the only thing possible. 
As he puts it, 'One has to be 
grown up enough to realize 
that life is not fair. You just 
have to do the best you can in 
the situation you are in.'— It 
was true in 1964, and still is 
today, that, as far as he is 
concerned, the less made of 
his physical problems the 
better. If this book were to 



talk about his scientific work 
and fail entirely to mention 
that doing such work possibly 
represents more of an 
achievement for him than it 
would for most people, that 
would suit him fine. One of 
the most important things you 
can learn about him is how 
unimportant his disability is. 
It isn't accurate to call him a 
sick man. Health involves 
much more than physical 



condition, and in this broader 
sense for most of his life he's 
been one of the healthiest 
persons around. That message 
comes through loud and clear 
in his writing and in most of 
the things written about him, 
and it is even more apparent 
when you're with him. That's 
the Hawking image, and 
though we should take 
seriously his warning 'You 
shouldn't believe everything 



you read', it isn't a fake 
image. 

Meanwhile, no marriage 
was possible until he had a 
job, and no job was possible 
without a Ph.D. He began 
looking for an idea with 
which to complete his thesis. 



Challenging the 
Future 

Though Hawking 's life had 



been in turmoil since the 
diagnosis in the winter of 
1963, neither his deteriorating 
physical condition nor his 
growing preoccupation with 
Jane Wilde had eclipsed his 
interest in cosmology. His 
office in the Department of 
Applied Maths and 
Theoretical Physics was next 
door to Jayant Narlikar, 
whom Hawking had met on a 
summer course before 



coming up to Cambridge. 
Narlikar was one of Hoyle's 
students and working with 
Hoyle on possible 
modifications to general 
relativity that might reconcile 
the Steady State model with 
recent observations that 
called it into question. This 
challenge piqued Hawking 's 
curiosity. 

In June 1964, prior to 
publication of Hoyle's work 



with Narlikar, Hoyle gave a 
lecture about it at the Royal 
Society. Hawking travelled to 
London to attend. When the 
floor was opened for 
questions, Hawking rose to 
his feet with the help of his 
stick and challenged one of 
Hoyle 's results. An 
astonished Hoyle asked 
Hawking how he could 
possibly judge whether the 
result was right or wrong. 



Hawking replied that he had 
'worked it out'. Unaware that 
Hawking and Narlikar had 
discussed the results many 
times and that Hawking had 
done calculations of his own, 
Hoyle and the audience 
assumed that this unknown 
research student had 'worked 
it out' in his head right there 
at the lecture. The audience 
was impressed; Hoyle was 
infuriated. Surprisingly, 



Hawking seems not to have 
lost the friendship of 
Narlikar. In any case, his 
reputation for brilliance and 
brashness had begun, and so 
had his interest in 
calculations and speculation 
having to do with the 
expanding universe. 

Hawking learned about a 
theory of the British 
mathematician and physicist 
Roger Penrose concerning 



what happens when a star has 
no nuclear fuel left to burn 
and collapses under the force 
of its own gravity. Penrose, 
building on earlier work by 
such physicists as 
Subrahmanyan 

Chandrasekhar and John 
Wheeler, claimed that even if 
the collapse isn't perfectly 
smooth and symmetrical, the 
star will nevertheless be 
crushed to a tiny point of 



infinite density and infinite 
curvature of space-time, a 
singularity at the heart of a 
black hole. 

Hawking took off from 
there by reversing the 
direction of time, imagining a 
point of infinite density and 
infinite curvature of 
spacetime - a singularity - 
exploding outwards and 
expanding. Suppose, he 
suggested, the universe began 



like that. Suppose spacetime, 
curled up tight in a tiny, 
dimensionless point, 
exploded in what we call the 
Big Bang and expanded until 
it looks the way it does today. 
Might it have happened like 
that? Must it have happened 
like that? 

With these questions, 
Hawking began the 
intellectual adventure that has 
continued for more than 



forty-five years. As he says, 
6 I started working hard for the 
first time in my life. To my 
surprise, I found I liked it. 
Maybe it is not really fair to 
call it work. ' 

1965 

In the winter of 1965 
Hawking applied for a 
research fellowship at 
Gonville and Caius College 
in Cambridge. Jane came up 



for the weekend from 
London, where she was still 
living while completing her 
degree at Westfield College, 
and Hawking reported that ' I 
was hoping that Jane would 
type my application, but she 
had her arm in plaster, having 
broken it. I must admit that I 
was less sympathetic than I 
should have been. However, 
it was her left arm, so she was 
able to write out my 



application to my dictation, 
and I got someone else to 
type it. ' 

Jane's arm was not the 
worst setback he encountered 
applying for the Caius 
fellowship. He was asked to 
name two persons as 
references. Denis Sciama 
suggested Hermann Bondi. 
Stephen had attended lectures 
in Bondi 's general relativity 
course at King's College 



London, but did not know 
him well. ' I had met him a 
couple of times and he had 
communicated a paper I had 
written to the Royal Society. I 
asked him [about giving a 
reference] after a lecture he 
gave in Cambridge. He 
looked at me in a vague way 
and said, yes, he would. 
Obviously, he didn't 
remember me, for, when the 
College wrote to him for a 



reference, he replied that he 
had not heard of me.' That 
should have doomed 
Hawking 's chances. It might 
today, with so many applying 
for research fellowships, but 
he was fortunate. 'Those were 
quieter times. The College 
wrote to tell me of the 
embarrassing reply of my 
referee. My supervisor got on 
to Bondi and refreshed his 
memory. Bondi then wrote 



me a reference that was 
probably far better than I 
deserved. Anyway I got the 
fellowship.' 

Another boost to 
Stephen's professional 
standing in the spring of 1965 
was a 'commendation prize' 
in the privately funded 
Gravity Prize Competition. 
He might have done better 
than 'commendation' had he 
not missed the deadline for 



submissions, but, with his 
wedding coming up, £100 
was welcome.- During that 
same spring, at an 
international conference on 
general relativity and 
gravitation in London - the 
first such event he ever 
attended - Stephen met Kip 
Thorne from the California 
Institute of Technology. 
Thorne already had his Ph.D. 
from Princeton. Thorne was 



deeply impressed with the 
way this young man who 
walked with a cane and 
seemed somewhat wobbly, 
and spoke with a slight 
hesitation, was taking 
techniques introduced into 
general relativity by Roger 
Penrose and adapting them to 
investigate the structure and 
history of the universe. Their 
conversation in a tearoom at 
the conference was the 



beginning of a life-long 
friendship. Thorne is one of a 
handful of friends, perhaps 
the only one, with whom 
Hawking has had frank, 
matter-of-fact discussions 
about his bleak expectations 
for the future. 

On 14 July 1965, Stephen 
Hawking and Jane Wilde 
were married in a civil 
ceremony, followed the next 
day by a religious ceremony 



in the chapel of Trinity Hall. 

Theoretical physics is full 
of paradoxes. It seems 
appropriate that one of our 
great theoretical physicists is 
a man whose enthusiasm for 
life was awakened by a 
tragedy that ought to have 
embittered and destroyed 
him, and that his meteoric 
rise as a scientist started with 
the practical need for a thesis 
topic so that he could get a 



job and marry. With what 
simplicity Hawking described 
it: in spite of the Wagner, the 
tragic hero self-image and the 
dreams; a year, maybe more, 
of depression ... then 'I was 
happier than I'd been before.'

usually happen in June. 



5 



The big question was, 
was there a beginning 
or not?' 

AFTER THEIR WEDDING and a 

short honeymoon in Suffolk, 
which was all they could 
afford, Stephen and Jane 



Hawking set out across the 
Atlantic to America for a 
general relativity summer 
school at Cornell University 
in upper New York State. The 
summer school was another 
opportunity for Hawking to 
meet top people in his field. 
However, he remembers the 
experience as ' a mistake'. 'It 
put quite a strain on our 
marriage, specially as we 
stayed in a dormitory that was 



full of couples with noisy 
small children. '- 

One summer evening at 
Cornell, chatting with friends 
in the night air - chilly in 
those climes despite the time 
of year - Hawking suddenly 
had a choking fit. He knew he 
should expect such episodes, 
but since he had resolutely 
refused to discuss his 
problems with Jane, she did 
not, and she had no idea what 



to do to help him. Finally he 
signalled her to give him a 
hard thump on the back. This 
solved the immediate 
problem, but the experience 
left Jane shaken and vividly 
aware of what faced them. 
'The demonic nature of the 
illness had announced its 
presence. '- 

In October, Hawking, 
aged twenty-three, began his 
fellowship at Caius. Jane 



Hawking had another year to 
go to complete her 
undergraduate degree at 
London University. As 
planned, Hawking would 
fend for himself during the 
week. She would join him for 
the weekends. Since he 
couldn't walk far or cycle, 
they needed Cambridge 
lodgings near his department. 
Before going to America they 
had applied for a flat being 



built in the market square. No 
one told them that those flats 
were actually owned by 
Hawking 's college, which 
might have given their 
application an advantage. As 
it turned out, that didn't 
matter because the flats 
weren't ready for occupancy 
that autumn. 

The bursar at Caius had 
earlier informed Stephen that 
Caius policy was not to help 



Fellows find housing. 
Relenting only slightly, he 
offered Stephen and Jane one 
room in a graduate student 
hostel and charged them 
double because there would 
be two of them living there at 
weekends. Then, three days 
after moving into the hostel, 
they discovered a small house 
available for three months in 
Little St Mary's Lane - one 
of a group of picturesque 



cottages that line one side of 
the lane across from Little St 
Mary's Church and 
churchyard garden. The 
house was only a hundred 
yards from the new 
Department of Applied 
Mathematics and Theoretical 
Physics (DAMTP) premises 
in Silver Street, where 
Stephen was sharing an office 
with another young physicist, 
Brandon Carter. He was able 



to walk that distance, and he 
acquired a small three- 
wheeled car to drive when he 
needed to get to the Institute 
of Astronomy in the 
countryside near town. Later 
that autumn, when their first 
three-month lease was 
approaching its end, the 
Hawkings learned that 
another house in the lane was 
unoccupied. A helpful 
neighbour located the owner 



in Dorset and upbraided her 
for having her house vacant 
while a young couple had no 
place to live. The owner 
agreed to rent. 

The choking fits became 
more frequent. Stephen's 
sister Mary, still working 
towards her medical degree at 
London University, suggested 
that warmer, drier weather 
might help. Partly on that 
advice, in December at the 



end of the Michaelmas term, 
the Hawkings took advantage 
of an opportunity to cross the 
ocean for a second time. 
Stephen attended an 
astrophysics conference in 
Miami, and from there they 
went on to Austin, Texas, to 
spend a week with one of his 
graduate school friends 
George Ellis and his wife. 
They returned to England in 
time for Christmas and the 



move into their second, more 
permanent home in Little St 
Mary's Lane. 

Both Stephen and Jane 
followed punishing schedules 
during that first year of their 
marriage. Hawking was still 
keenly aware of his lack of 
mathematical background. 
Being, as his mother has said, 
a 'self-educator', he decided 
to use a time-honoured 
graduate student method of 



improving one's own 
knowledge while also earning 
some money: if you want or 
need to learn a subject, teach 
it. So, in addition to working 
on his Ph.D. thesis, he 
supervised undergraduate 
mathematics for the college.- 
Jane managed her weekly 
commute, finished her 
undergraduate degree, 
engineered the move from 
one house to another, and 



typed her husband's Ph.D. 
dissertation. 

They celebrated the 
completion of Stephen's 
Ph.D. in March 1966, and 
there was more to celebrate. 
Hawking had submitted an 
essay, 'Singularities and the 
Geometry of Space-Time', in 
competition for the 
prestigious Adams Prize, 
awarded by St John's 
College, Cambridge, and 



named for John Couch 
Adams, co-discoverer of the 
planet Neptune. The winner 
had to be a young researcher 
who was based in Britain, and 
the work had to be of 
international calibre. 
Hawking's essay was co- 
winner with Roger Penrose's 
entry. A proud Denis Sciama 
told Jane that, in his opinion, 
Stephen could look forward 
to a career worthy of Isaac 



Newton.- In spite of his 
physical difficulties and bleak 
prospects, these were halcyon 
days: Cambridge in the 1960s 
was an extremely stimulating 
place for someone with 
Hawking 's interests. 
Everything seemed possible. 
Surprisingly much was!- 

That spring, Jane 
Hawking, eager to maintain 
some intellectual identity and 
purpose of her own, decided 



to continue her education and 
work towards a Ph.D. from 
London University. For her 
thesis topic she chose a 
critical treatment of 
previously published 
medieval Spanish texts. This 
topic allowed her to do her 
research in libraries rather 
than from primary sources. 
Even so, deciding to pursue a 
Ph.D. was a bold step, for 
Stephen was requiring more 



and more care and it was also 
about this time that the 
Hawkings decided to start a 
family. In the autumn of 
1966, when Jane's first 
pregancy began, Stephen's 
fingers were beginning to curl 
and writing by hand became 
almost impossible for him. In 
an extraordinary move, for 
which Sciama was 
responsible, the Institute of 
Physics funded physical 



therapy at home for him twice 
a week.- 

The Hawkings' first child, 
Robert, was born on 28 May 
1967. It was four years since 
doctors had told Stephen 
Hawking he had two years to 
live. He was still on his feet, 
and he was a father. Jane 
recalls: 'It obviously gave 
Stephen a great new impetus, 
being responsible for this tiny 
creature.' 2 



Robert was still an infant 
when his parents whisked 
him off to America, on their 
first visit to the west coast. 
Hawking attended a seven- 
week summer school in 
Seattle, Washington. After 
this there was a fortnight at 
the University of California, 
Berkeley. He was living up to 
the reputation for 
'international calibre' that 
had helped him win the 



Adams Prize. They ended the 
trip with a hop across the 
continent to spend time with 
Hawking 's childhood friend 
John McClenahan (the friend 
who had bet that Hawking 
would never amount to 
anything) and Hawking' s 
sister Mary, who now was 
practising medicine in the 
eastern United States. After 
nearly four months in 
America, Stephen, Jane and 



their baby returned to 
Cambridge in October in time 
for the Michaelmas term. 
Caius College had renewed 
Stephen's fellowship for two 
more years. 

People who remember 
Stephen Hawking in the 
DAMTP in the mid- to late 
1960s recall his making his 
way around the corridors with 
a cane, supporting himself 
against the wall and speaking 



with what sounded like a 
speech impediment. More 
than that, they remember his 
brashness in sessions 
involving some of the world's 
most distinguished scientists. 
The reputation that had begun 
when he challenged Fred 
Hoyle in 1964 was being 
reinforced regularly. While 
other young researchers kept 
a reverent silence, Hawking 
daringly asked unexpected 



and penetrating questions and 
clearly knew what he was 
talking about. The comments 
about ' a genius', 'another 
Einstein', began then. In spite 
of Hawking 's ready wit and 
popularity, that reputation 
and his physical problems 
distanced him from some in 
the department. One 
acquaintance told me: 'He 
was very friendly always, but 
at the same time, some felt a 



little shy about asking him 
out with the gang for a beer at 
the pub.' It's no wonder 
Hawking feels it's been a 
problem preventing people 
from thinking of him as 
'anything less or more than 
simply human '.- 

In the late 1960s, 
Hawking 's physical condition 
began deteriorating again. He 
had to use crutches. Then it 
became difficult for him to 



get about even with crutches. 
He waged a pitched battle 
against the loss of his 
independence. A visitor 
remembers watching him 
spend fifteen minutes getting 
up the stairs to bed on his 
crutches, determined to do it 
without help. His 
determination sometimes 
seemed to be pigheadedness. 
Hawking refused to make 
concessions to his illness, 



even when those 

'concessions' were practical 
steps to make things easier 
for him and make him less of 
a burden to others. It was his 
battle. He would fight it his 
way. His way was to regard 
any concession as caving in, 
an admission of defeat, and to 
resist as long as possible. 
'Some people would call it 
determination, some 
obstinacy,' says Jane 



Hawking. 'I've called it both 
at one time or another. I 
suppose that's what's kept 
him going.'- John Boslough, 
who wrote a book about 
Hawking in the early 1980s, 
called him 'the toughest man 
I have ever met'.— Even with 
a bad cold or flu, Hawking 
rarely missed a day of work. 
Meanwhile, while Hawking 
refused to make concessions 
to his illness, Jane Hawking 



learned to make no 
concessions to him. This was 
her way of fighting and part 
of her campaign to keep his 
life as normal as possible. 

Boslough also described 
Hawking as a 'gentle, witty 
man', who quickly made you 
forget about his physical 
problems. That 'gentle' wit 
cut through all nonsense and 
pretension. Hawking' s ability 
to make light of himself, his 



problems, and even the 
science he was so keen on 
was awe-inspiring. It helped 
others to like him and most of 
the time eclipsed the feelings 
of 'differentness'. For some 
he became, in the department, 
the most fun to be around. 
Hawking seems to have been 
following, without probably 
ever having read it, the advice 
Louisa May Alcott's mother 
gave her family in times of 



overwhelming distress: 'Hope 
and keep busy.' 

Hawking 's future was 
more threatened by his 
communication problems 
than by his immobility. His 
speech was becoming more 
and more slurred and 
indistinct, so much so that 
Caius College and the 
University had to face the fact 
that he could not give regular 
lectures. His research 



fellowship was about to 
expire again in 1969. Once 
more Denis Sciama saved the 
day, this time with help from 
Hermann Bondi. A rumour 
got about - no one knows 
who started it, and maybe it 
was true that King's 
College, just down the street, 
was going to offer Hawking a 
Senior Research Fellowship. 
Caius came up with a way to 
keep him - a six-year contract 



for a specially created 
'Fellowship for Distinction in 
Science'. Hawking was 
becoming an important 
physicist. He was far too 
valuable to lose. 

Hawking 's science 
continued to occupy his mind 
far more than concern about 
canes and crutches and stairs. 
His almost obsessive 
enjoyment of his work set the 
tone of his life. In the late 



1960s he was finding out 
what the universe is like and 
how it might have begun - 
what he describes as playing 
'the game of universe'. In 
order to understand the work 
he was immersed in, we have 
to go back thirty- five years. 

The Game of 
Universe 

Today we take it for granted 



that we live in a lacy spiral 
disc galaxy - the Milky Way 
- one of many galaxies more 
or less like it in the universe, 
with vast stretches of space 
between them. Early in the 
twentieth century not 
everyone accepted this 
picture. It was the American 
astronomer Edwin Hubble 
who, in the 1920s, showed 
that there are indeed many 
galaxies besides our own. Is 



there any pattern to the 
movement of these galaxies? 
Hubble showed that there is, 
with one of the most 
revolutionary discoveries of 
the century: the distant 
galaxies are all moving away 
from us. The universe is 
expanding. 

Hubble found that the 
more distant a galaxy is, the 
more rapidly it's moving 
away from us: twice as far, 



twice as fast. We observe 
some extremely distant 
galaxies receding as fast as 
two-thirds the speed of light. 
Does that mean every star in 
the universe is moving away 
from us? No. Our near 
neighbours are milling 
around, some approaching, 
some receding. It's between 
clusters of galaxies that space 
is expanding. The most 
helpful way to think of the 



expansion of the universe is 
not as things rushing away 
from one another but as space 
between them swelling. It's 
an oversimplification, but 
imagine a loaf of raisin bread 
rising in the oven. As the 
dough swells, the raisins 
move apart. 'Twice as far, 
twice as fast' works with 
raisins as well as with 
galaxies. 

If galaxies are receding 



from us and from each other, 
then unless something has 
changed drastically 
somewhere along the line, 
they used to be much closer 
together. At some moment in 
the past, wouldn't they all 
have been in exactly the same 
place? All the enormous 
amount of matter in the 
universe packed in a single 
point, infinitely dense? 

That isn't the only 



possible history of an 
expanding universe. Perhaps 
there was once a universe 
something like ours, and that 
universe contracted, with all 
its galaxies getting closer 
together, looking as though 
they were on collision course. 
But galaxies and stars, and 
atoms and particles, for that 
matter, have other motion in 
addition to the motion that 
draws them straight towards 



one another. Planets orbit 
stars, for instance. The result 
in that universe might have 
been that, instead of meeting 
in a point of infinite density, 
the galaxies, or the particles 
that made them up, missed 
one another, flew past, and 
the universe expanded again 
until it looks the way it does 
today. Could it have 
happened like that? Which 
way did it happen? These 



were questions Hawking had 
begun to consider in his Ph.D. 
thesis. 'The big question 
was,' says Hawking, 'was 
there a beginning or not?' 11 

His search for an answer 
began, as we mentioned in 
Chapter 4 . with an idea 
introduced by Roger Penrose 
in 1965. Penrose's idea 
concerned the way some stars 
may end up - something that 
three years later was going to 



be given the spectacular name 
'black hole' by John 
Archibald Wheeler. The 
concept combined what we 
know about gravity with what 
general relativity tells us 
about the behaviour of light. 
Hawking 's friend Kip Thorne 
would later remember 1965- 
80 as a golden age of black 
hole research. In the 
enormous achievements 
made, Hawking was in the 



vanguard.— 

What Do We Know 
about Gravity and 
Light? 

Gravity is the most familiar 
of the four forces. We all 
learned early in life that it's 
gravity you blame when your 
ice cream cone splats on the 
rug or when you fall off a 
swing. Asked to guess 



whether gravity is a very 
weak or a very strong force, 
you might answer 'incredibly 
strong'. You would be wrong. 
It's by far the weakest of the 
four forces. The gravity that's 
so conspicuous in our 
everyday lives is the gravity 
of this great hulk of a planet 
we live on, the combined 
gravity of every particle in it. 
The contribution of each 
individual particle is 



infinitesimal. It takes 
sensitive instruments to detect 
the faint gravitational 
attraction between small, 
everyday objects. However, 
because gravity always 
attracts, never repels, it has a 
talent for adding up. 

Physicist John Wheeler 
liked to think of gravity as a 
sort of universal democratic 
system. Every particle has a 
vote that can affect every 



other particle in the universe. 
When particles band together 
and vote as a bloc (in a star, 
for instance, or in our Earth), 
they wield more influence. 
The very weak gravitational 
attraction of the individual 
particles in large bodies like 
the Earth adds up to a 
significant force: an 
influential voting bloc. 

The more matter particles 
there are making up a body, 



the more mass that body has. 
Mass is not the same as size. 
Mass is a measure of how 
much matter is in an object, 
how many votes are in the 
voting bloc (regardless of 
how densely or loosely the 
matter is packed), and how 
much the object resists any 
attempt to change its speed or 
direction. 

Sir Isaac Newton, 
Lucasian Professor of 



Mathematics at Cambridge in 
the 1600s, the same position 
Hawking would hold, 
discovered laws explaining 
how gravity works in more or 
less normal circumstances. 
According to Newton, bodies 
are not 'at rest' in the 
universe. They don't just sit 
still until some force comes 
along to push or pull them 
and then later 'run down' and 
sit still again. Instead, a body 



left completely undisturbed 
continues to move in a 
straight line without changing 
speed. It's best to think of 
everything in the universe as 
being in motion. We can 
measure our speed or 
direction in relation to other 
objects in the universe, but 
we can't measure them in 
relation to absolute stillness 
or anything that resembles 
absolute north, south, east, 



west, or up or down. 

For example, if our moon 
were alone in space, it would 
not sit still but rather move in 
a straight line without 
changing its speed. (Of 
course, if it were truly all 
alone, there would be no way 
to tell it was doing this, 
nothing to which we could 
relate its motion.) But the 
moon isn't all alone. A force 
known as gravity acts on the 



moon to change its speed and 
direction. Where does that 
force come from? It comes 
from a nearby voting bloc of 
particles (a massive object) 
known as the Earth. The 
moon resists the change. It 
tries to keep moving in a 
straight line. How well it's 
able to resist depends on how 
many votes are in it, how 
massive it is. Meanwhile, the 
moon's gravity also affects 



the Earth. The most obvious 
result is the ocean tides. 

Newton's theory tells us 
that the amount of mass a 
body has affects how strong 
the pull of gravity is between 
it and another body. Other 
factors remaining equal, the 
greater the mass, the greater 
the attraction. If the Earth 
were double its present mass, 
the attraction of gravity 
between the Earth and the 



moon would be double what 
it currently is. Any change in 
the mass of either the Earth or 
the moon would change the 
strength of the gravitational 
pull between them. Newton 
also discovered that the 
farther apart bodies are, the 
weaker the pull between them 
is. If the moon were twice its 
present distance from the 
Earth, the pull of gravity 
between the Earth and the 



moon would be only one- 
fourth as strong. Newton's 
theory is usually stated: 
Bodies attract each other with 
a force that is proportional to 
their mass and inversely 
proportional to the square of 
the distance between them. 

Newton's theory of 
gravity is an extremely 
successful theory. It wasn't 
improved on for over two 
hundred years. We still use it, 



though we now know that it 
fails in some circumstances, 
such as when gravitational 
forces become enormously 
strong (near a black hole, for 
instance) or when bodies are 
moving at near light speed. 

Albert Einstein, early in 
the twentieth century, saw a 
problem with Newton's 
theory. If the strength of 
gravity between two objects 
is related to the distance 



between them, then if 
someone takes the sun and 
moves it farther from the 
Earth, the force of gravity 
between the Earth and the sun 
should change instantly. Is 
this possible? 

Einstein's theory of 
special relativity recognized 
that the speed of light 
measures the same no matter 
where you are in the universe 
or how you're moving and 



that nothing can move faster 
than the speed of light. Light 
from the sun takes about eight 
minutes to reach Earth. We 
always see the sun as it was 
eight minutes ago. So, move 
the sun farther from the 
Earth; the Earth won't find 
out this has happened and feel 
any effect of the change for 
eight minutes. For eight 
minutes we'll continue to 
orbit just as though the sun 



hadn't moved. In other 
words, the effect of the 
gravity of one body on the 
other cannot change 
instantaneously because 
gravity can't move faster than 
the speed of light. 
Information about how far 
away the sun is cannot move 
instantaneously across space. 
It can move no faster than 
about 186,000 miles (300,000 
kilometres) per second. 



It's obvious then that 
when we talk about things 
moving in the universe, it's 
not realistic to talk in terms of 
only the three dimensions of 
space. If no information can 
travel faster than the speed of 
light, things out there at 
astronomical distances simply 
don't exist for us or for each 
other without a time factor. 
Describing the universe in 
three dimensions is as 



inadequate as describing a 
cube in two. Instead we must 
recognize the time dimension, 
admit there are really four 
dimensions, and talk of 
spacetime. 

Einstein spent several 
years developing a theory of 
gravity that would work with 
what he'd discovered about 
light and motion at near light 
speed. In 1915 he introduced 
his theory of general 



relativity, requiring us to 
think of gravity not as a force 
acting between bodies but in 
terms of the shape, the 
curvature, of four- 
dimensional spacetime itself. 
In general relativity gravity is 
the geometry of the universe. 

Bryce DeWitt, at the 
University of Texas, 
suggested we begin thinking 
about this curvature by 
imagining someone who 



believes the Earth is flat 
trying to draw a grid on the 
Earth: 



The result can be seen 
from an airplane on 
any clear day over the 
cultivated regions of 
the Great Plains. The 
land is subdivided by 
east-west and north- 
south roads into 
square-mile sections. 



The east-west roads 
often extend in 
unbroken lines for 
many miles, but not 
the north-south roads. 
Following a road 
northward, there are 
abrupt jogs to the east 
or west every few 
miles. The jogs are 
forced by the 
curvature of the Earth. 
If the jogs were 



eliminated, the roads 
would crowd together, 
creating sections of 
less than a square 
mile. In the three- 
dimensional case one 
can imagine building 
a giant scaffold in 
space out of straight 
rods of equal length 
joined at angles of 
precisely 90 degrees 
and 180 degrees. If 



space is flat, the 
construction of the 



difficulty. If space is 
curved, one would 
eventually have to 
begin shortening the 
rods or stretching 
them to make them 



scaffold 
proceed 



would 
without 



According to Einstein the 



curvature is caused by the 
presence of mass or energy. 
Every massive body 
contributes to the curvature of 
spacetime. Things going 
'straight ahead' in the 
universe are forced to follow 
curved paths. Imagine a 
trampoline ( Figure 5.1 ). In its 
centre lies a bowling ball, 
which causes a depression in 
the rubber sheet. Try to roll a 
golf ball in a straight line past 



the bowling ball. The golf 
ball will certainly change 
direction slightly when it 
meets the depression caused 
by the bowling ball. It will 
probably do more than that: it 
may even describe an ellipse 
and roll back in your 
direction. Something like that 
happens as the moon tries to 
continue in a straight line past 
the Earth. The Earth warps 
spacetime as the bowling ball 



warps the rubber sheet. The 
moon's orbit is the nearest 
thing to a straight line in 
warped spacetime. 



Figure 5.1. A bowling ball bends a 
rubber sheet where it lies. If you 
try to roll a smaller ball past the 

bowling ball, the path of the 
smaller ball will be bent when it 
encounters the depression caused 
by the bowling ball. In a similar 
manner, mass bends spacetime. 
Paths of objects in spacetime are 
bent when they encounter the 
curvature caused by a more 
massive object. 

Einstein was describing 
the same phenomenon that 



Newton described. To 
Einstein a massive object 
warps spacetime. To Newton 
a massive object sends out a 
force. The result, in each 
case, is a change in the 
direction of a second object. 
According to the theory of 
general relativity, 
'gravitational field' and 
'curvature' are the same 
thing. 

If you calculate planetary 



orbits in our solar system 
using Newton's theories and 
then calculate them again 
using Einstein's, you get 
almost precisely the same 
orbits, except in the case of 
Mercury. Because Mercury is 
the nearest planet to the sun, 
it's affected more than the 
others by the sun's gravity. 
Einstein's theory predicts a 
result of this nearness which 
is slightly different from the 



result predicted by Newton's 
theory. Observation shows 
that Mercury's orbit fits 
Einstein's prediction better 
than Newton's. 

Einstein's theory predicts 
that other things besides 
moons and planets are 
affected by the warp of 
spacetime. Photons (particles 
of light) have to travel a 
warped path. If a beam of 
light is travelling from a 



distant star and its path takes 
it close to our sun, the 
warping of spacetime near the 
sun causes the path to bend 
inwards towards the sun a bit, 
just as the path of the golf 
ball bends inwards towards 
the bowling ball in our 
model. Perhaps the path of 
light bends in such a way that 
the light finally hits the Earth. 
Our sun is too bright for us to 
see such starlight except 



during an eclipse of the sun. 
If we see it then and don't 
realize the sun is bending the 
path of the star's light, we're 
going to get the wrong idea 
about which direction the 
beam of light is coming from 
and where that star actually is 
in the sky ( Figure 5.2 ). 
Astronomers make use of this 
effect. They measure the 
mass of objects in space by 
measuring how much they 



bend the paths of light from 
distant stars. The greater the 
mass of the 'bender', the 
greater the bending. 




Figure 5.2. Because mass causes 
curvature of spacetime, the path of 
light travelling from a distant star 
bends as it passes a massive body 
like the sun. Notice the difference 
between the position of the star as 
we see it from the Earth and its 
true position. 

We've been talking about 
gravity in terms of what we 
observe on the large scale. 
That, of course, is the scale 
on which gravity becomes 
conspicuous - in stars, 



galaxies, even the entire 
universe - and that is the 
scale Hawking was dealing 
with in the late sixties. 
However, recall from Chapter 
2 that gravity can also be 
looked at in terms of the very 
small, the quantum level. In 
fact, unless we can study it 
there, we will never get it 
unified with the other three 
forces, two of which work 
exclusively on that level. The 



quantum-mechanical way of 
looking at the gravitational 
attraction between the Earth 
and the moon is to picture it 
as an exchange of gravitons 
(the bosons, or messenger 
particles, of the gravitational 
force) between the particles 
that make up those two 
bodies. 

With that background, 
we'll treat ourselves to a little 
science fiction. 



A Disastrous Day for 
Earth 

Remind yourself what the 
force of gravity feels like on 
Earth ( Figure 5.3 a ). then 
pretend you go off on a 
vacation in space. While 
you're away something 
drastic happens to the Earth: 
it gets squeezed to only half 
its original size. It still has the 
same mass, but that mass is 



pressed together much more 
tightly. Returning from your 
vacation, your spacecraft 
hovers for a while at the place 
in space where the Earth's 
surface used to be before the 
squeezing. You feel as heavy 
there as you did before you 
went away. The pull of the 
Earth's gravity there hasn't 
changed, because neither 
your mass nor that of the 
Earth has changed, and you 



are still the same distance as 
before from the Earth's centre 
of gravity. (Remember 
Newton!) The moon, out 
beyond you, still orbits as 
before. However, when you 
land on the new surface (a 
much smaller radius, quite a 
bit nearer the Earth's centre 
of gravity), the gravity on that 
new surface is four times 
what you remember on the 
Earth's surface before the 



squeezing. You feel much 
heavier ( 5.3b ). 

What if something far 
more dramatic happened? 
What if the Earth were 
squeezed to the size of a pea 
- all the mass of the Earth, 
billions of tons, squeezed into 
that tiny space? Gravity on its 
surface would be so strong 
that escape velocity would be 
greater than the speed of 
light. Even light couldn't 



escape. The Earth would be a 
black hole. However, at the 
radius out in space where the 
surface of the Earth was 
before any squeezing, the pull 
of the Earth's gravity would 
still feel just the same as it 
does to us today ( Figure 
5.3c ). The moon would still 
be orbiting just as before. 

As far as we know, that 
story can't happen. Planets 
don't become black holes. 



However, there's a good 
chance some stars do. Let's 
retell the story, this time with 
a star. 

Begin with a star that has 
a mass about ten times that of 
the sun. The star's radius is 
about 3 million kilometres, 
about five times that of the 
sun. Escape velocity is about 
1,000 kilometres per second. 
Such a star has a life span of 
about a hundred million 



years, during which a life- 
and-death struggle goes on 
within it. 

On one side of the contest 
is gravity: the attraction of 
every particle in the star for 
every other. It was gravity 
that pulled particles in a gas 
together to form the star in 
the first place. The pull is 
even more powerful now that 
the particles are closer 
together. Gravity tries to 



make the star collapse. 

The pressure of the gas in 
the star opposes gravity. This 
pressure comes from heat 
released when hydrogen 
nuclei in the star collide and 
merge to form helium nuclei. 
The heat makes the star shine 
and creates enough pressure 
to resist gravity and prevent 
the star from collapsing.

block no longer have any meaning 
they've been torn apart. 



Figure 5.3. The day the Earth gets

The star is shrinking, but si

The curvature of spacetime becomes so great 
that light can no longer escape. The star

The event horizon, the border of the 
black hole, stays the same size while 
the star continues to shrink Inside it, 



The star shrinks to a angularity 
where the density and the curvature 
of spacetime are infinite, 



Figure 5.4. A star collapses and 
becomes a black hole. 

For a hundred million 
years the contest continues. 
Then the star runs out of fuel: 
no more hydrogen to convert 
into helium. Some stars then 
convert helium into heavier 
elements, but that gives them 
only a short reprieve. When 
there's no more pressure to 
counteract gravity, the star 
shrinks. As it does, the 



gravity on its surface 
becomes stronger and 
stronger, in the same way that 
gravity on the Earth's surface 
did in the shrinking Earth 
story. It won't have to shrink 
to the size of a pea to become 
a black hole. When the 10- 
solar-mass star's radius is 
about 20 miles (30 
kilometres), escape velocity 
on its surface will have 
increased to 186,000 miles 



(300,000 kilometres) per 
second, the speed of light. 
When light can no longer 
escape, the star becomes a 
black hole (Figure 5.4 ). M 



Figure 5.5. In (a), particles from 
space move towards a star. The 
paths of particles 1, 2 and 3 are 
bent as they pass the star. The 
closer to the star, the greater the 
bending. Particles 4 and 5 hit the 
surface of the star. In (b), we see 
the same particles moving towards 
the star after it has become a black 
hole. The paths of particles 1, 2 
and 3 are bent exactly as before, 
because the spacetime outside a 
star is the same as the spacetime 
outside a black hole of the same 



mass. (Recall the shrinking Earth.) 

Particle 4 circles the black hole 
and then escapes. It might circle it 
many times. Particle 5 is captured 
by the black hole. 

After the escape velocity 
on its surface is greater than 
the speed of light, we don't 
have to ask whether the star 
goes on shrinking. Even if it 
doesn't, we still have a black 
hole. Remember how gravity 
at the original radius never 



changed in the Earth- 
shrinking story. Whether our 
star goes on shrinking to a 
point of infinite density or 
stops shrinking just within the 
radius where escape velocity 
reaches the speed of light, 
gravity at that radius is going 
to feel the same, as long as 
the star's mass doesn't 
change. Escape velocity at 
that radius is the speed of 
light and will stay the speed 



of light. Light coming from 
the star will find escape 
impossible. Nearby beams of 
light from distant stars won't 
only be bent; they may curl 
around the black hole several 
times before escaping or 
falling in ( Figure 5.5 ). If the 
light enters the black hole, it 
cannot escape. Nothing can 
achieve a greater velocity 
than the speed of light. What 
a profound 'blackout' we 



have! No light, no reflection, 
no radiation of any kind 
(radio, microwave, X-ray and 
so on), no sound, no sight, no 
space probe, absolutely no 
information can escape. A 
black hole indeed! 

The radius where escape 
velocity is the speed of light 
becomes the border of the 
black hole, the radius-of-no- 
return: the 'event horizon'. 
Hawking and Penrose, in the 



late 1960s, suggested 
defining a black hole as an 
area of the universe, or a 'set 
of events', from which it's 
impossible for anything to 
escape to a distance. That has 
become the accepted 
definition. A black hole, with 
its event horizon for an outer 
boundary, is shaped like a 
sphere, or, if it's rotating, a 
bulged-out sphere that looks 
elliptical when seen from the 



side (or would, if you could 
see it). The event horizon is 
marked by the paths in 
spacetime of rays of light that 
hover just on the edge of that 
spherical area, not being 
pulled in but unable to 
escape. Gravity at that radius 
is strong enough to stop their 
escape but not strong enough 
to pull them back. Will you 
see them as a great orb 
shimmering in space? No. If 



the photons can't escape from 
that radius, they can't reach 
your eyes. In order for you to 
see something, photons from 
it have to reach your eyes. 

Classical black hole 
theory tells us that there are 
only three secrets a black hole 
divulges: its mass, its electric 
charge (if it has any), and its 
angular momentum or speed 
of rotation (if it is rotating). 
John Wheeler, who liked to 



draw helpful pictures on the 
chalk-board for his students, 
drew a television set, a 
flower, a chair, 'known 
particles', gravitational and 
electromagnetic waves, 
angular momentum, mass and 
even 'particles as yet 
undetected' falling into a 
black hole, shown as a funnel, 
and nothing coming out at the 
bottom of the funnel except 
mass, electric charge and 



angular momentum. Part of 
Hawking 's work in the early 
1970s- would help to show 
that, as Wheeler summed it 
up: 'Black holes have no 
hair. ' 

It's the mass of the black 
hole that determines its size. 
If you want to calculate the 
radius of a black hole (the 
radius at which the event 
horizon forms), take the solar 
mass of the black hole (the 



same as for the star that 
collapsed to form it unless 
that star lost mass earlier in 
the collapse) and multiply by 
2 for miles or 3 for 
kilometres. You'll find that a 
10-solar-mass black hole (that 
is, a black hole whose mass is 
ten times the mass of our sun) 
has its event horizon at a 
radius of 20 miles (30 
kilometres). It's clear that if 
the mass changes, the radius 



where the event horizon is 
also changes. The black hole 
changes in size. We'll talk 
more about this possibility 
later. 

Having drawn the curtain 
at the event horizon, the star 
has complete privacy, while 
any light it emits (any picture 
of itself that otherwise would 
be viewed from elsewhere in 
the universe) is pulled back 
in. Penrose had wanted to 



know whether the star would 
go on collapsing - or just 
what would happen to it. He 
had discovered that a star 
collapsing as we've described 
has all its matter trapped 
inside its own surface by the 
force of its own gravity. Even 
if the collapse isn't perfectly 
spherical and smooth, the star 
does go on collapsing. The 
surface eventually shrinks to 
zero size, with all the matter 



still trapped inside. Our 
enormous 10-solar-mass star 
is then confined not just in a 
region with a 20-mile (30- 
kilometre) radius (where its 
event horizon is), but rather 
in a region of zero radius - 
zero volume. Mathematicians 
and physicists call that a 
singularity. At such a 
singularity the density of 
matter is infinite. Spacetime 
curvature is infinite, and 



beams of light aren't just 
curled around: they're wound 
up infinitely tightly. 

General relativity predicts 
the existence of singularities, 
but in the early 1960s few 
took this prediction seriously. 
Physicists thought that a star 
of great enough mass 
undergoing gravitational 
collapse might form a 
singularity. Penrose had 
shown that if the universe 



obeys general relativity, it 
must. 

fnl Stars less massive than 
about 8 solar masses probably 
don't shrink all the way to 
become black holes. Only 
more massive stars become 
black holes. 



There is a singularity 
in our past' 



PENROSE'S DISCOVERY THAT a 

star of great enough mass 
undergoing gravitational 
collapse must form a 
singularity set fire to 



Hawking. With Robert 
Geroch and Penrose, he 
began to extend ideas about 
singularities to other physical 
and mathematical cases. 1 He 
was certain the discovery had 
significant implications for 
the beginning of the universe. 
This was exhilarating work, 
with the 'glorious feeling of 
having a whole field virtually 
to ourselves'.- Hawking 
realized that if he reversed the 



direction of time so that the 
collapse became an 
expansion, everything in 
Penrose's theory would still 
hold. If general relativity tells 
us that any star that collapses 
beyond a certain point must 
end in a singularity, then it 
also tells us that any 
expanding universe must 
have begun as a singularity. 
For this to be true the 
universe must be like what 



scientists call a Friedmann 
model. What is a Friedmann 
model of the universe? 

A Choice of 
Universes 

Before Hubble demonstrated 
that the universe is 
expanding, belief in a static 
universe (one that isn't 
changing in size) was very 
strong, so much so that when 



Einstein produced his theory 
of general relativity in 1915, 
and that theory predicted the 
universe was not static, 
Einstein was so sure it was 
static that he revised his 
theory. He put in a 
'cosmological constant' to 
balance gravity. Without this 
cosmological constant the 
theory of general relativity 
predicted what we now know 
to be true: the universe is 



changing in size. 

A Russian physicist, 
Alexander Friedmann, 
decided to take Einstein's 
theory at face value without 
the cosmological constant. 
Doing so, he predicted what 
Hubble would discover in 
1929: The universe is 
expanding. 

Friedmann began with 
two assumptions: (1) the 
universe looks much the same 



in whatever direction you 
look (except for nearby things 
like the shape of our Milky 
Way galaxy and our solar 
system); (2) the universe 
looks like this from wherever 
you are in the universe. In 
other words, no matter where 
you travel in space, the 
universe still looks much the 
same in whatever direction 
you look. 

Friedmann's first 



assumption is fairly easy to 
accept. The second isn't. We 
don't have any scientific 
evidence for or against it. 
Hawking says, 'We believe it 
only on grounds of modesty: 
it would be most remarkable 
if the universe looked the 
same in every direction 
around us, but not around 
other points in the universe!' 2 
Perhaps remarkable, but not 
impossible, you may argue. 



Modesty seems no more 
logical a reason for believing 
something than pride. 
However, physicists tend to 
agree with Friedmann. 

In Friedmann 's model of 
the universe all the galaxies 
move away from one another. 
The farther apart two galaxies 
are, the more rapidly they 
move away from one another. 
This agrees with what Hubble 
observed. According to 



Friedmann, wherever you 
travel in space you'll still find 
all the galaxies moving away 
from you. In order to 
understand this, imagine an 
ant crawling on a balloon that 
has evenly spaced dots 
painted on it. You have to 
pretend the ant can't see the 
dimension that would allow it 
to look 'out' from the surface. 
Nor is it aware that the 
balloon has an interior. The 



ant's universe involves only 
the surface of the balloon. It 
looks the same in any 
direction. No matter where 
the ant crawls on the balloon, 
it sees as many dots ahead of 
it as behind. If the balloon is 
getting larger, the ant sees all 
the dots move away, no 
matter where it stands on the 
surface. The balloon 
'universe' fits Friedmann's 
two assumptions: it looks the 



same in all directions. It looks 
the same no matter where you 
are in it. 

What else can we say 
about the balloon universe? It 
isn't infinite in size. The 
surface has dimensions we 
can measure, like the surface 
of the Earth. No one would 
suggest that the surface of the 
Earth is infinite in size. 
However, it also has no 
boundaries, no ends. 



Regardless of where the ant 
crawls on the surface, it never 
comes up against any barrier, 
finds any end to the surface, 
or falls off an edge. It 
eventually gets back to where 
it started. 

In Friedmann's original 
model, space is like that, with 
three dimensions rather than 
two. Gravity bends space 
around on to itself. The 
universe is not infinite in size, 



but neither does it have any 
end, any boundary. A 
spaceship will never get to a 
place in space where the 
universe ends. That may be 
difficult to understand, 
because we tend to think of 
infinite as meaning 'having 
no end'. The two do not have 
the same meaning. 

Hawking points out that 
although the idea of 
circumnavigating the 



universe and ending up where 
you started makes great 
science fiction, it doesn't 
work, at least with this 
Friedmann model. You'd 
have to break the speed limit 
of the universe (the speed of 
light) - which isn't allowed - 
to get all the way around 
before the universe ends. It's 
an extremely large balloon. 
We are extremely small ants. 
Time in this Friedmann 



model, like space, isn't 
infinite. It can be measured. 
Time, unlike space, does have 
boundaries: a beginning and 
an end. Look at Figure 6.1a . 
The distance between two 
galaxies at the beginning of 
time is zero. They move 
apart. The expansion is slow 
enough and there is enough 
mass in the universe so that 
eventually gravitational 
attraction stops the expansion 



and causes the universe to 
contract. The galaxies move 
towards each other again. At 
the end of time the distance 
between them is once again 
zero. That may be what our 
universe is like. 

Figures 6.1b and 6.1c 
show two other possible 
models that would also obey 
Friedmann's assumptions 
(that the universe looks the 
same in every direction and 



that it looks the same from 
wherever you are in the 
universe). In Figure 6.1b . the 
expansion is much more 
rapid. Gravity can't stop it, 
though it does slow it a little. 
In Figure 6.1c . the universe is 
expanding just fast enough 
not to collapse, but not as fast 
as in Figure 6.1b . The speed 
at which galaxies are moving 
apart grows smaller and 
smaller, but they always 



continue to move apart. If the 
universe is like either of these 
two models, space is infinite. 
It doesn't curve back around 
on to itself. 




Time 



Figure 6.1. Three models that obey 
Friedmann 's assumptions that the 
universe looks much the same in 
any direction we look, and the 
universe looks much the same from 
wherever you might be in the 
universe. 

Which model fits our 
universe? Will the universe 
collapse some day or go on 
expanding for ever? It 
depends on how much mass 
there is in the universe: how 



many votes there are in the 
entire democracy. It will take 
much more mass than we 
presently observe to close the 
universe. That is a very 
simple statement of a more 
complicated issue, as you'll 
see later. 

Penrose's theory about 
stars collapsing and becoming 
singularities only worked 
with a universe infinite in 
space that will go on 



expanding for ever (as in 
Figures 6.1b and 6.1c ). not 
collapse (as in Figure 6.1a ). 
Hawking first set out to prove 
that a universe infinite in 
space not only would have 
singularities in black holes 
but also must have begun as a 
singularity. He was confident 
enough by the time he 
finished his thesis to write: 
'There is a singularity in our 
past.'- 



In 1968, Hawking 's and 
Penrose's essay on the 
beginning of time won 
second place in the Gravity 
Research Foundation Awards, 
but the question still hung in 
the balance: what if 
Friedmann's first model was 
correct, where the universe is 
not infinite in space and 
eventually recollapses ( Figure 
6.1a )? Must that sort of 
universe also have begun as a 



singularity? By 1970 
Hawking and Penrose were 
able to show that it must 
have. Their definitive 
statement on the subject, in 
the 1970 Proceedings of the 
Royal Society,- was a joint 
paper proving that if the 
universe obeys general 
relativity and fits any of the 
Friedmann models, and if 
there is as much matter in the 
universe as we observe, the 



universe must have begun as 
a singularity, where all the 
mass of the universe was 
compressed to infinite 
density, where spacetime 
curvature was infinite. 

Physical theories can't 
really work with infinite 
numbers. When the theory of 
general relativity predicts a 
singularity of infinite density 
and infinite spacetime 
curvature, it's also predicting 



its own breakdown. In fact, 
all our scientific theories 
break down at a singularity. 
We lose our ability to predict. 
We can't use the laws of 
physics to say what would 
emerge from the singularity. 
It could be any sort of 
universe. And what about the 
question of what happened 
before the singularity? It's 
not even clear that this 
question has any meaning. 



A singularity at the 
beginning of the universe 
would mean that the 
beginning of the universe is 
beyond our science, beyond 
anything that claims to be a 
Theory of Everything. We 
would simply have to say, 
time began, because we 
observe that it did, and that in 
itself is a very big arbitrary 
element. A singularity is a 
door slammed in our faces. 



Bedtime Story 

Physicists are notorious for 
being eternally preoccupied 
with their physics. Even more 
than most of his colleagues, 
and partly as a consequence 
of his disability, Hawking 
was able to take his work 
with him anywhere, any time, 
because it was almost all 
done in his head. As Kip 
Thorne described it, he had 
developed a very unusual 



ability to manipulate mental 
images of objects, curves, 
surfaces, shapes, not merely 
in three dimensions but in 
spacetime's four dimensions. - 
Typical of Hawking 's 
work mode was a bedtime 
discovery he described in his 
book A Brief History of Time: 
'One evening in November of 
1970, shortly after the birth of 
my daughter, Lucy, I started 
to think about black holes as I 



was getting into bed. My 
disability makes this rather a 
slow process, so I had plenty 
of time.' 2 Another physicist 
might have nipped over to his 
desk and scribbled some 
notes and equations, but 
Hawking made one of the 
most significant discoveries 
of his career in his head, got 
into bed, and lay awake for 
the rest of the night, eager for 
dawn to break so that he 



could phone Penrose and tell 
him about his new insight. 
Penrose, Hawking insists, had 
thought of it but had not 
realized the implications. 

The idea that had struck 
Hawking was that a black 
hole can never get smaller 
because the area of an event 
horizon (the radius-of-no- 
return where escape velocity 
becomes greater than the 
speed of light) can never 



decrease. 

To review briefly, a 
collapsing star reaches a 
radius where escape velocity 
is the speed of light. What 
happens to photons emitted 
by the star as it collapses past 
that radius? Gravity there is 
too strong to allow them to 
escape, but not strong enough 
to pull them into the black 
hole. They stay there, 
hovering. That radius is the 



event horizon. After that as 
the star continues to shrink, 
any photons it emits are 
drawn back in. 

What Hawking realized 
was that the paths of light 
rays hovering at the event 
horizon cannot be paths of 
light rays that are 
approaching one another. 
Paths of light rays that 
approach one another would 
bash into one another and fall 



into the black hole, not hover. 
In order for the area of the 
event horizon to get smaller 
(and the black hole to get 
smaller), paths of light rays in 
the event horizon would have 
to approach one another. But, 
if they did, they would fall in, 
and the event horizon would 
not get smaller. 

Another way of thinking 
about this is to realize that a 
black hole can get larger. 



The size of a black hole is 
determined by its mass, so a 
black hole gets larger any 
time anything new falls in 
and adds to that mass. If 
nothing can get out of a black 
hole, its mass can't possibly 
decrease. A black hole can't 
get smaller. 

Hawking 's discovery 
became known as the second 
law of black hole dynamics: 
the area of the event horizon 



(the border of the black hole) 
can stay the same or increase 
but never decrease. If two or 
more black holes collide and 
form one black hole, the area 
of the new event horizon is as 
big as or bigger than the 
previous event horizons 
added together. A black hole 
can't get smaller or be 
destroyed or divided into two 
black holes, no matter how 
hard it might get zapped. 



Hawking 's discovery had a 
familiar ring to it. It 
resembled another 'second 
law' in physics: the second 
law of thermodynamics, 
which is about entropy. 

Entropy is the amount of 
disorder there is in a system. 
Disorder always increases, 
never decreases. An 
assembled jigsaw puzzle put 
carefully in a box might get 
jostled, mixing the pieces and 



spoiling the picture. But it 
would be very surprising if 
any jostling of the box caused 
a mess of unassembled pieces 
to fall into place and 
complete the puzzle picture. 
In our universe, entropy 
(disorder) always increases. 
Broken teacups never 
reassemble themselves. A 
messy room never straightens 
itself up. 

Suppose you patch the 



teacup or tidy up the room. 
Something does become more 
ordered. Does entropy 
decrease? No. The mental and 
physical energy you burn in 
the process converts energy 
to a less useful form. That 
represents a decrease in the 
amount of order in the 
universe which outbalances 
any increase of order you 
achieved. 

There's another way in 



which entropy resembles the 
event horizon of a black hole. 
When two systems join, the 
entropy of the combined 
system is as great as or 
greater than the entropy of the 
two systems added together. 
A familiar example describes 
gas molecules in a box. Think 
of them as little balls 
bouncing off one another and 
off the walls of the box. 
There's a partition down the 



centre of the box. Half the 
box (one side of the partition) 
is filled with oxygen 
molecules. The other half is 
filled with nitrogen 
molecules. Remove the 
partition, and oxygen and 
nitrogen molecules start to 
mix. Soon there's a fairly 
uniform mixture throughout 
both halves of the box, but 
that's a less ordered state than 
when the partition was in 



place: entropy - disorder - 
has increased. (The second 
law of thermodynamics 
doesn't always hold: there is 
the tiniest of chances, one in 
many millions of millions, 
that at some point the 
nitrogen molecules will be 
back in their half of the box 
and the oxygen molecules in 
the other.) 

Suppose you toss the box 
of mixed-up molecules or 



anything else that has entropy 
into a convenient black hole. 
So much for that bit of 
entropy, you might think. The 
total amount of entropy 
outside the black hole is less 
than it was before. Have you 
managed to violate the 
second law? Someone might 
argue that the whole universe 
(inside and outside black 
holes) hasn't lost any entropy. 
But the fact is that anything 



going into a black hole is just 
plain lost to our universe. Or 
is it? 

One of John Wheeler's 
graduate students at 
Princeton, Demetrios 
Christodoulou, pointed out 
that according to the second 
law of thermodynamics, the 
entropy (disorder) of a closed 
system always increases, 
never decreases, and that 
similarly the 'irreducible 



mass' (Christodoulou's name 
for a mathematical 
combination between a black 
hole's mass and its speed of 
rotation) never decreases, no 
matter what happens to the 
black hole. Was this 
resemblance only a 
coincidence? What 
connection could 
Christodoulou's idea or 
Hawking 's more general and 
powerful statement 2 (the 



never-decreasing area of the 
event horizon) have with 
entropy and the second law of 
thermodynamics? 

Escape from a Black 
Hole? 

In his first announcement to 
the scientific community of 
his idea about the event 
horizon of a black hole never 
getting smaller, in December 



1970 at the Texas 
Symposium of Relativistic 
Astrophysics,- Hawking 
insisted that though an 
increase in the area of the 
event horizon did indeed 
resemble an increase of 
entropy, this was only an 
analogy. 

Another of Wheeler's 
graduate students at 
Princeton, Jacob Bekenstein, 
begged to differ. Bekenstein 



insisted that the area of the 
event horizon of a black hole 
isn't only like entropy; it is 
entropy.- When you measure 
the area of the event horizon, 
you're measuring the entropy 
of the black hole. You don't 
destroy entropy if you toss it 
into a black hole. The black 
hole already has entropy. You 
only increase it. When 
something falls into a black 
hole, such as a box of 



molecules, it adds to the mass 
of the black hole, and the 
event horizon gets larger. It 
also adds to the entropy of the 
black hole. 

All of this brings us to a 
puzzling point. If something 
has entropy, that means it has 
a temperature. It is not totally 
cold. If something has a 
temperature, it has to be 
radiating energy. If 
something is radiating 



energy, you can't say that 
nothing is coming out. 
Nothing was supposed to 
come out of black holes. 

Hawking thought 
Bekenstein was mistaken. He 
was irritated by what he 
thought was Bekenstein' s 
misuse of his discovery that 
event horizons never 
decrease. In 1972 and 1973 
he joined forces with two 
other physicists, James 



Bardeen and Brandon Carter, 
and seemed to tread close to a 
concession by coming up 
with no fewer than four laws 
of black hole mechanics that 
appeared to be almost 
identical to the four well- 
known laws of 
thermodynamics 'if one only 
replaced the phrase "horizon 
area" with "entropy," and the 
phrase "horizon surface 
gravity" with 



"temperature" '.— 
Nevertheless the three authors 
continued to stress that these 
were only analogies, and in 
the final version of their 
paper- reiterated that their 
four laws of black hole 
mechanics were similar to, 
but distinct from, the four 
laws of thermodynamics. 
Although there were many 
similarities between entropy 
and the area of the event 



horizon, a black hole could 
not have entropy because it 
could not emit anything. That 
was an argument that 
Bekenstein could not gainsay, 
but even though he was a 
graduate student up against a 
trio of established physicists, 
he was not convinced. It 
turned out that Hawking, 
Bardeen and Carter were 
wrong. It would fall to 
Hawking himself to show 



how. 

In 1962 when Hawking 
had begun his graduate 
studies at Cambridge, he'd 
chosen cosmology, the study 
of the very large, rather than 
quantum mechanics, the 
study of the very small. Now, 
in 1973, he decided to shift 
ground and look at black 
holes through the eyes of 
quantum mechanics. It was to 
be the first serious, successful 



attempt by anybody to fuse 
the two great theories of the 
twentieth century: relativity 
and quantum mechanics. 
Such a fusion, you'll 
remember from Chapter 2 . is 
a difficult hurdle on the road 
to a Theory of Everything. 

In January 1973, 
Hawking was thirty-one years 
old. The new year brought the 
publication of his first full- 
length book, co-authored with 



George Ellis and dedicated to 
Denis Sciama. Hawking 
describes The Large Scale 
Structure of Space-Time as 
'highly technical, and quite 
unreadable'.- It still appears 
on the shelves of academic 
bookshops, and if you pull it 
down, and are not an 
accomplished physicist, you 
will probably agree with him. 
Although it will never match 
the sales of A Brief History oj 



Time, it has become a classic 
in the field. 

In August and September 
of that year, during 
Cambridge's long vacation, 
Stephen and Jane Hawking 
travelled to Warsaw for the 
celebration of the 500th 
anniversary of the birth of 
Nicolaus Copernicus, and 
continued east from there to 
Moscow. They asked Kip 
Thorne to go with them, 



because he had been carrying 
on joint research with Soviet 
physicists for five years and 
knew the ropes in the Soviet 
Union. Hawking wanted to 
confer with Yakov 
Borisovich Zel'dovich and 
Zel'dovich's graduate student 
Alexander Starobinsky. These 
two Russian physicists had 
been able to show that the 
uncertainty principle meant 
that rotating black holes 



would create and emit 
particles, produced by the 
hole's rotational energy. The 
radiation would come from 
just outside the event horizon 
and would slow down the 
black hole's rotation until the 
rotation stopped and the 
radiation ceased. Hawking 
thought Zel'dovich and 
Starobinsky were on to 
something, but he wasn't 
satisfied with their 



calculations. After the visit he 
returned to Cambridge 
determined to devise a better 
mathematical treatment. 

Hawking expected his 
calculations to show that 
rotating black holes produce 
the radiation the Russians 
predicted. What he 
discovered was something far 
more dramatic: ' I found, to 
my surprise and annoyance, 
that even nonrotating black 



holes should apparently 
create and emit particles at a 
steady rate.'- At first he 
thought something had to be 
wrong with his calculations 
and he spent many hours 
trying to find his error. He 
was particularly eager that 
Jacob Bekenstein should not 
find out about his discovery 
and use it as an argument 
supporting his idea about 
event horizons and entropy. 



But the more Hawking 
thought about it, the more he 
had to admit that his own 
calculations were certainly 
not far off the mark. The 
clincher was that the 
spectrum of the emitted 
particles was precisely what 
you'd expect from any hot 
body. 

Bekenstein was right: 
You cannot make entropy 
decrease and the universe get 



more orderly by throwing 
matter carrying entropy into 
black holes as though they 
were great rubbish bins. As 
matter carrying entropy goes 
into a black hole, the area of 
the event horizon gets larger: 
the entropy of the black hole 
increases. The total entropy 
of the universe both inside 
and outside black holes hasn't 
become any less. 

But Hawking was on to a 



bigger puzzle now. How can 
black holes possibly have a 
temperature and emit 
particles if nothing can 
escape past the event 
horizon? He found the answer 
in quantum mechanics. 

When we think of space 
as a vacuum, we haven't got 
it quite right. We've already 
seen that space is never a 
complete vacuum. Now we'll 
find out why. 



The uncertainty principle 
means we can never know 
both the position and the 
momentum of a particle at the 
same time with complete 
accuracy. It means something 
more than that: we can never 
know both the value of a field 
(a gravitational field or an 
electromagnetic field, for 
instance) and the rate at 
which the field is changing 
over time with complete 



accuracy. The more precisely 
we know the value of a field, 
the less precisely we know 
the rate of change, and vice 
versa: the seesaw again. The 
upshot is that a field can 
never measure zero. Zero 
would be a very precise 
measurement of both the 
value of the field and its rate 
of change, and the uncertainty 
principle won't allow that. 
You don't have empty space 



unless all fields are exactly 
zero: no zero - no empty 
space. 

Instead of the empty 
space, the true vacuum, that 
most of us assume is out 
there, we have a minimum 
amount of uncertainty, a bit 
of fuzziness, as to just what 
the value of a field is in 
'empty' space. One way to 
think of this fluctuation in the 
value of the field, this 



wobbling a bit towards the 
positive and negative sides of 
zero so as never to be zero, is 
as follows: 

Pairs of particles - pairs 
of photons or gravitons, for 
instance - continually appear. 
The two particles in a pair 
start out together then move 
apart. After an interval of 
time too short to imagine they 
come together again and 
annihilate one another - a 



brief but eventful life. 
Quantum mechanics tells us 
this is happening all the time, 
everywhere in the 'vacuum' 
of space. These may not be 
'real' particles that we can 
detect with a particle detector, 
but they are not imaginary. 
Even if they are only 'virtual' 
particles, we know they exist 
because we can measure their 
effects on other particles. 
Some of the pairs will be 



pairs of matter particles, 
fermions. In this case, one of 
the pair is an antiparticle. 
'Antimatter', familiar from 
fantasy games and science 
fiction (it drives the starship 
Enterprise), isn't purely 
fictional. 

You may have heard that 
the total amount of energy in 
the universe always stays the 
same. There cannot be any 
suddenly appearing from 



nowhere. How do we get 
around that rule with these 
newly created pairs? They're 
created by a very temporary 
'borrowing' of energy. 
Nothing permanent at all. 
One of the pair has positive 
energy. The other has 
negative energy. The two 
balance out. Nothing is added 
to the total energy of the 
universe. 

Hawking reasoned that 



there will be many particle 
pairs popping up at the event 
horizon of a black hole. The 
way he pictures it, a pair of 
virtual particles appears. 
Before the pair meet again 
and annihilate, the one with 
negative energy crosses the 
event horizon into the black 
hole. Does that mean the 
positive energy partner must 
follow its unfortunate 
companion in order to meet 



and annihilate? No. The 
gravitational field at the event 
horizon of a black hole is 
strong enough to do an 
astounding thing to virtual 
particles, even those 
unfortunates with negative 
energy: it can change them 
from 'virtual' to 'real'. 

The transformation makes 
a remarkable difference to the 
pair. They are no longer 
obliged to find one another 



and annihilate. They can both 
live much longer, and 
separately. The particle with 
positive energy might fall 
into the black hole, too, of 
course, but it doesn't have to. 
It's free of the partnership. It 
can escape. To an observer at 
a distance it appears to come 
out of the black hole. In fact, 
it comes from just outside. 
Meanwhile, its partner has 
carried negative energy into 



the black hole ( Figure 6.2 ). 

The radiation that's 
emitted by black holes in this 
manner is now called 
Hawking radiation. And with 
Hawking radiation, his 
second famous discovery 
about black holes, Hawking 
showed that his first famous 
discovery, the second law of 
black hole dynamics (that the 
area of the event horizon can 
never decrease), doesn't 



always hold. Hawking 
radiation means that a black 
hole might get smaller and 
eventually evaporate entirely. 
It was a truly radical concept. 



Near the event horizon of a black hole, 
there will be many pairs of particles.

BUT - the one with negative energy might fall into the black hole and get changed 
from a short-lived Virtual' particle to a 'real' particle. (Normally it couldn't be 'real' 
if it had negative energy.) That frees its positive energy partner from the 
partnership. The positive energy partner may escape into space.

This one is about to fall in, 
which will free its partner. 

Notice that the

from INSIDE 
the black hole. 



Figure 6.2. Hawking radiation 

How does Hawking 
radiation make a black hole 
get smaller? As the black hole 
transforms virtual particles to 
real particles, it loses energy. 
How can this happen, if 
nothing escapes through the 
event horizon? How can it 
lose anything? It's rather a 
trick answer: when the 



particle with negative energy 
carries this negative energy 
into the black hole, that 
makes less energy in the 
black hole. Negative means 
'minus', which means less. 

That's how Hawking 
radiation robs the black hole 
of energy. When something 
has less energy, it 
automatically has less mass. 
Remember Albert Einstein's 
equation, E = mc 2 . The E 



stands for energy, the m for 
mass, the c for the speed of 
light. When the energy (on 
one side of the equal sign) 
grows less (as it is doing in 
the black hole), something on 
the other side of the equal 
sign grows less too. The 
speed of light (c) can't 
change. It must be the mass 
that grows less. So, when we 
say a black hole is robbed of 
energy, we're also saying it's 



robbed of mass. 

Keep this in mind and 
recall what Newton 
discovered about gravity: any 
change in the mass of a body 
changes the amount of 
gravitational pull it exerts on 
another body. If the Earth 
becomes less massive (not 
smaller this time, less 
massive), its gravitational 
pull feels weaker out where 
the moon is orbiting. If a 



black hole loses mass, its 
gravitational pull becomes 
weaker out where the event 
horizon (the radius-of-no- 
return) has been. Escape 
velocity at that radius 
becomes less than the speed 
of light. There is now a 
smaller radius where escape 
velocity is the speed of light. 
A new event horizon forms 
closer in. The event horizon 
has shrunk. This is the only 



way we know that a black 
hole can get smaller. 

If we measure Hawking 
radiation from a large black 
hole, one resulting from the 
collapse of a star, we'll be 
disappointed. A black hole 
this size has a surface 
temperature of less than a 
millionth of a degree above 
absolute zero. The larger the 
black hole the lower the 
temperature. Hawking says, 



'Our 10-solar-mass black 
hole might emit a few 
thousand photons a second, 
but they would have a 
wavelength the size of the 
black hole and so little energy 
we would not be able to 
detect them.'- The way it 
works is that the greater the 
mass, the greater the area of 
the event horizon. The greater 
the area of the event horizon, 
the greater the entropy. The 



greater the entropy, the lower 
the surface temperature and 
the rate of emission. 

Exploding Black 
Holes? 

However, as early as 1971 
Hawking had suggested that 
there was a second type of 
black hole: tiny ones, the 
most interesting ones about 
the size of the nucleus of an 



atom. These would positively 
crackle with radiation. The 
smaller a black hole is, the 
hotter its surface temperature. 
Referring to these tiny black 
holes, Hawking declares: 
'Such holes hardly deserve 
[to be called] black: they 
really are white hot. 9 — 

'Primordial black holes', 
as Hawking called them, 
would not have formed from 
the collapse of stars. They 



would be relics of the very 
early universe when there 
were pressures that could 
press matter together 
extremely tightly. A 
primordial black hole would 
by now be much smaller even 
than when it started out. It's 
been losing mass for a long 
time. 

Hawking radiation would 
have drastic consequences for 
a primordial black hole. As 



the mass grows less and the 
black hole gets smaller, the 
temperature and rate of 
emission of particles at the 
event horizon increase. The 
hole loses mass more and 
more quickly. The lower the 
mass, the higher the 
temperature a vicious 
circle! 

How would the story end? 
Hawking guessed that the 
little black hole disappears in 



a huge final puff of particle 
emission, like millions of 
hydrogen bombs exploding. 
Will a large black hole ever 
explode? Some models have 
it that the universe will come 
to an end long before it 
reaches that stage. 

The idea that a black hole 
could get smaller and finally 
explode was so much the 
reverse of everything 
anybody thought about black 



holes in 1973 that Hawking 
had grave doubts about his 
discovery. For weeks he kept 
it under wraps, reviewing the 
calculations in his head. If he 
found it so hard to believe, it 
was fearful to predict what 
the rest of the scientific world 
would make of it. No scientist 
enjoys the prospect of 
ridicule. On the other hand, 
Hawking knew that if he was 
right, his findings would 



revolutionize astrophysics. At 
one point he locked himself 
in the bathroom to think 
about the problem. ' I worried 
about this all over Christmas, 
but I couldn't find any 
convincing way to get rid of 
[these findings].' n 

Hawking tested his idea 
on his close associates. The 
reception was mixed. Martin 
Rees, a friend since their days 
as graduate students at 



Cambridge, approached their 
old thesis supervisor, Denis 
Sciama, with the exclamation, 
'Have you heard? Stephen's 
changed everything!' Sciama 
rallied to Hawking 's support, 
urging him to release his 
findings. Hawking 
complained that Penrose 
phoned him, full of 
enthusiasm, just as he was 
sitting down to his 1974 
birthday dinner, ready to tuck 



into his goose. He appreciated 
Penrose's excitement, 
Hawking said, but, once into 
the subject, they talked too 
long. His dinner got cold.- 

Hawking agreed to 
present his bizarre discovery 
in February in a paper at the 
Rutherford-Appleton 
Laboratory south of Oxford. 
Sciama was the organizer of 
the meeting, the Second 
Quantum Gravity 



Conference. Hawking had 
hedged his bets a little by 
putting a question mark in the 
title of his paper, 'Black Hole 
Explosions?', but, travelling 
to Oxford, he still agonized 
over his decision to announce 
his discovery. 

The short presentation, 
including slides of equations, 
was greeted with silence that 
became embarrassing, and 
few questions. Hawking 's 



arguments had gone over the 
heads of many in the 
audience, experts in other 
fields. But it was more or less 
obvious to everyone that he 
was proposing something 
completely contrary to 
accepted theory. Those who 
did understand were shocked 
and unprepared to argue with 
him. The lights were snapped 
back on. The moderator, John 
G. Taylor, a respected 



professor from the University 
of London, rose and declared: 
'Sorry, Stephen, but this is 
absolute rubbish. '— 

Hawking published this 
'rubbish' the next month in 
the prestigious science 
magazine Nature.— Taylor 
and Paul C. W. Davies 
disagreed with Hawking in a 
paper in the same issue.- 
Within a few days physicists 
all over the world were 



discussing Hawking 's 

shocking idea. Zel'dovich 
had reservations at first, but 
when Kip Thorne was next in 
Moscow he had an urgent 
summons to visit the Soviet 
physicist. When Thorne 
arrived, Zel'dovich and 
Starobinsky greeted him with 
hands in the air, as though 
they were in the old 
American West and Thorne 
had them at gunpoint: 'We 



give in. Hawking was right. 
We were wrong. '— 

Some were calling 
Hawking 's discovery the 
most significant in theoretical 
physics in years. Sciama said 
the paper was 'one of the 
most beautiful in the history 
of physics'.- John Wheeler, 
always a master with words, 
said that talking about 
Hawking ' s beautiful 
discovery was like 'rolling 



candy on the tongue'.- Kip 
Thorne commented that as 
Stephen had lost the use of 
his hands he had developed 
'geometrical arguments that 
he could do pictorially in his 
head ... a very powerful set 
of tools that nobody else 
really had. And if you are the 
only master in the world of 
these new tools, that means 
there are certain kinds of 
problems you can solve and 



nobody else can.'- Things 
were certainly looking up. 

Hawking took more time 
and care putting together a 
second paper about his 
discovery. Communications 
in Mathematical Physics, the 
journal to which he submitted 
it in March 1974, lost his 
paper and didn't publish it 
until April 1975,^ after he 
resubmitted it. In the 
meantime, Hawking and his 



colleagues went on studying 
'Hawking radiation' from 
many different angles. By the 
time the next four years had 
passed - and after a joint 
paper written by Hawking 
and Jim Hartle appeared in 
1976- - Hawking radiation 
had been generally accepted 
throughout the theoretical 
physics world. Most agreed 
that Hawking had made a 
significant breakthrough. He 



had used the activity of 
virtual particles to explain 
about something that had 
arisen from the theory of 
relativity - black holes. He'd 
taken a step towards linking 
relativity and quantum 
physics. 



PART II 
1970-1990

These people must 
think we are used to an 
astronomical standard 
of living' 

WHEN LUCY WAS bom On 2 

november 1970, the 
Hawkings had recently 



purchased the house they had 
been renting in Little St 
Mary's Lane. Stephen's 
parents had given them 
money to fix it up and qualify 
for a mortgage. The work had 
finally been completed when 
Jane was eight months 
pregnant. 

Stephen was still insisting 
on pulling himself up and 
down the stairs and dressing 
himself in the morning and 



undressing at night. His 
comment that he had plenty 
of time to think about photons 
at the event horizons of black 
holes while getting ready for 
bed is one of very few 
admissions he has made that 
any of this was extremely 
slow and arduous. His 
walking, however, finally 
became so perilous that he 
consented to a wheelchair. 
He'd lost the battle to stay on 



his feet. Friends watched with 
sadness, but Hawking's 
humour and strength of 
purpose didn't fail him. 

Hawking's loss of the use 
of his hands, meaning he 
could no longer write and 
draw equations and diagrams, 
did not happen overnight. 
Over the years of gradual 
loss, he had time to adapt and 
train 'his mind to think in a 
manner different from the 



minds of other physicists. He 
thinks in new types of 
intuitive mental pictures and 
mental equations that, for 
him, have replaced paper-and 
pen drawings and written 
equations,' said Kip Thorne. 1 
Listening to Hawking 
himself, you get the 
impression that he believes he 
might have chosen this way 
of working even if he had full 
use of his hands: 'Equations 



are just the boring part of 
mathematics. I prefer to see 
things in terms of geometry. '- 
The calculations involved in 
the discovery of Hawking 
radiation were done almost 
entirely in his head. 

After Lucy's birth, Jane 
was juggling an all but 
impossible schedule, trying to 
finish her Ph.D. thesis while 
caring for Stephen, her 
toddler Robert and now her 



new baby girl. Her mother 
and a neighbour's nanny 
helped with the children 
whenever they could. The 
cottage in Little St Mary's 
Lane was a delight. As the 
children grew and Lucy 
became a proficient toddler, 
she joined her brother to play 
among the flowering plants 
and ancient stone markers in 
the Little St Mary's 
churchyard across the lane. 



Jane remembers summers 
with the windows open and 
the happy voices of her 
children 'piping in the 
churchyard'. 

When Hawking 's January 
1971 entry in the yearly 
Gravity Research Foundation 
Award, titled 'Black Holes', 
won top prize, the prize 
money allowed the Hawkings 
to buy a new car. Hawking 
had a salary from Caius and 



research assistantships from 
the DAMTP and the Institute 
of Astronomy. However, the 
family budget was still tight 
and not adequate to pay for a 
private school for Robert 
when he reached school age. 
He began instead at the fine 
local school, Newnham Croft 
Primary School, which my 
own daughter would attend 
fifteen years later. Robert 
seemed to be following in his 



father's footsteps, excelling 
in maths and slow learning to 
read, but it was a new era, 
when 'slow learning to read' 
was not to be accepted 
without taking proactive 
steps. Together with 
Stephen's parents, Jane and 
Stephen bought half shares in 
a small terraced house. The 
rent from it would provide 
money for Robert's fees at a 
private school where his 



mathematical prowess could 
be particularly respected and 
encouraged, as well as a 
retirement income for his 
grandparents.- Robert 
transferred to the Perse 
School in Cambridge when 
he was seven. 

The Hawkings continued 
to try to keep Stephen's 
illness in the background of 
their lives and not allow it to 
become the most important 



thing about him or about 
them. They made a habit of 
not looking to the future. As 
far as the rest of the world 
could see, they succeeded so 
well that it came as a surprise 
when Jane Hawking 
mentioned how terrible the 
difficulties sometimes were. 
Discussing honours that had 
come her husband's way, she 
told an interviewer: 6 I 
wouldn't say [this 



overwhelming success 
makes] all the blackness 
worthwhile. I don't think I 
am ever going to reconcile in 
my mind the swings of the 
pendulum we have 
experienced from the depths 
of a black hole to the heights 
of all the glittering prizes. '- 
To judge from everything 
Stephen Hawking has written, 
he barely noticed the depths. 
Talking about them in any but 



the most offhand manner, 
which is the most he allows 
himself, would be for him a 
form of giving in, of defeat, 
and could undermine his 
resolute disregard of his 
problems. Most of the time, 
he continued to refuse to 
discuss his illness even with 
Jane, but that didn't, for her, 
make it any less the gorilla in 
the room. 

Jane remembers that 



being unable to assist with his 
children or play with them in 
an active way was difficult 
for Stephen. She taught 
Robert, and later Lucy and 
Timmy, to play cricket ('I can 
get them out!' she gloated), 
and she teased her husband 
that, unlike other wives, she 
was not surprised or 
disillusioned when he proved 
useless around the house and 
with the children. 



Hawking ' s practical 
uselessness became one of 
the positive side effects of his 
illness. It might take him a 
long time to get up and go to 
bed, but he didn't have to run 
errands, do home repairs, 
mow the grass, make travel 
arrangements, pack his 
suitcase, draw up lecture 
schedules or serve in time- 
consuming administrative 
positions in the damtp or at 



Caius. Such matters were left 
to colleagues and assistants 
and to his wife. He could 
spend all his time thinking 
about physics, a luxury which 
his colleagues envy him. 

Jane had anticipated that 
an overwhelming proportion 
of these day-to-day 
responsibilities would fall to 
her. She had decided even 
before they were married in 
the 1960s that only one of 



them would be able to have a 
career, and it would have to 
be her husband. In the 1970s, 
perhaps partly because 
attitudes about the role of 
women were changing, that 
sacrifice became more 
difficult for her to accept. 
She'd thought that providing 
Stephen with the 

encouragement and assistance 
he so badly needed would 
give her life purpose and 



meaning. What it was not 
giving her was an identity. 
Motherhood wasn't doing 
that either. As she put it, 
although she adored her 
children and 'would not have 
wanted to farm them out to 
anybody else, Cambridge is a 
jolly difficult place to live if 
your only identity is as the 
mother of small children'. - 

To be fair to the 
university community, 



whenever you mentioned the 
name Hawking in Cambridge 
someone was likely to 
comment that Jane Hawking 
was even more remarkable 
than Stephen. However, Jane 
Hawking didn't feel that was 
her reputation. As she saw it, 
in Cambridge 'the pressure is 
on you to make your way 
academically'.- That of 
course was the reason she had 
decided to go back to 



university to earn her Ph.D., 
but her drafts for that thesis 
were far too often languishing 
on the shelf. 

Jane had much to be 
proud of in the 1970s. Robert 
and Lucy were turning out 
well; Hawking 's career as a 
physicist was skyrocketing; 
his reputation as a remarkably 
tough and good-humoured 
man when the odds were 
against him was becoming 



legendary; and she was 
beginning to make her own 
mark academically. At the 
same time she felt 
increasingly that her 
enormous and burdensome 
role in Hawking 's success 
went largely unnoticed. Hers 
was a problem which is not 
unusual for persons with a 
talent for making things look 
easy: others begin to assume 
that things are easy for them 



and fail to appreciate the 
sacrifice and effort involved. 
Both Jane and her husband 
knew that none of his success 
- probably not even his 
survival could have 

happened without her, but she 
was allowed to share little of 
the triumph. In photos of him 
she was sometimes cropped 
out, thought to be a nurse 
pushing his wheelchair. Nor 
could she follow his 



mathematical reasoning and 
share his pleasure in that. 
Nevertheless, 'the joy and 
excitement of Stephen's 
success were tremendous', 2 
she says. She did not regret 
the decision she made to 
marry him, but the rewards 
'didn't alleviate the 
heartrending difficulties of 
coping day after day with 
motor neurone disease'. - 
In spite of the difficulties 



there were many pleasures 
the Hawkings shared. Both of 
them were devoted to their 
children. They loved classical 
music and attended concerts 
and the theatre together. At 
Christmas they took Robert 
and Lucy to the pantomime. 
They also loved entertaining. 
Don Page, who as a 
postgraduate researcher 
would live with the Hawkings 
for three years as Hawking 's 



assistant, remembers that 
Jane Hawking was 'very 
outgoing ... a great 
professional asset' to her 
husband.- It wasn't unheard 
of to find her in the market 
shopping for a party of sixty 
people. The Hawkings 
became renowned for their 
hospitality. 

Both of them were also 
deeply interested in 
increasing public awareness 



of the needs of disabled 
people and the possibility that 
they might expect to live 
normal, even brilliantly 
successful and active lives. 
This was not so much a part 
of our culture in the 1970s as 
it is becoming today. Britain 
had passed its Chronically 
Sick and Disabled Person's 
Act in 1970, but that was very 
slow in implementation. 
Occasionally, Jane Hawking 



felt indignant enough to 
protest. She wrote a letter to 
the board of the National 
Trust when Anglesey Abbey, 
a house and gardens open to 
visitors near Cambridge, 
insisted the Hawkings park in 
a car park half a mile away, 
not near the house.- Jane was 
soon adding campaigning for 
the rights of disabled people 
to her already over-long list 
of activities. 



The Hawkings won some 
battles for wheelchair access. 
After a lengthy bureaucratic 
dispute about who should pay 
for it, a ramp was built at the 
back entrance into the damtp 
building. The Arts Theatre 
began reserving spaces for 
wheelchairs. The Arts 
Cinema also made room. 
Elsewhere, the English 
National Opera at the 
Coliseum made access 



possible. Where there was no 
such access, anyone near at 
hand was likely to be 
conscripted to lift Hawking 
and his chair up and down 
stairs. At Clare Hall, a 
graduate college of the 
University of Cambridge, 
members of the Astronomy 
Group were regularly called 
upon for this duty before and 
after their meetings. It wasn't 
always a safe procedure. 



Attendants at the Royal 
Opera House in Covent 
Garden dropped Stephen 
while carrying him up a flight 
of stairs to otherwise 
inaccessible seats .— 

Faith in God and the 
Laws of Physics 

Looking back in the late 
1980s, Jane Hawking 
attributed her ability to cope 



for so many years with their 
unusual and often difficult 
life - a life with no hope of a 
long or happy future - to her 
faith in God. Without that, 
she said, 4 1 wouldn't have 
been able to live in this 
situation. I wouldn't have 
been able to marry Stephen in 
the first place, because I 
wouldn't have had the 
optimism to carry me 
through, and I wouldn't be 



able to carry on with it.'— 

The faith which supported 
her so magnificently was not 
shared by her husband. It was 
shared by some of his physics 
colleagues, but the subject 
was not one she usually 
discussed with them. If there 
has been a religious or 
philosophical side to Stephen 
Hawking 's confrontation with 
disability and the threat of 
early death, he's never 



spoken about that publicly. 
However, it seems evident 
from his books A Brief 
History of Time and The 
Grand Design that God is 
never far from Hawking 's 
mind. He told an interviewer 
in the 1980s: 'It is difficult to 
discuss the beginning of the 
universe without mentioning 
the concept of God. My work 
on the origin of the universe 
is on the borderline between 



science and religion, but I try 
to stay [on the scientific] side 
of the border. It is quite 
possible that God acts in 
ways that cannot be described 
by scientific laws. But in that 
case one would just have to 
go by personal belief.'- 
Asked whether he thought his 
science is in competition with 
religion, he answered, 'If one 
took that attitude, then 
Newton [who was a very 



religious man] would not 
have discovered the law of 
gravity. '— 

Hawking said he wasn't 
an atheist, but he preferred to 
'use the term God as the 
embodiment of the laws of 
physics'.- 'You don't need to 
appeal to God to set the initial 
conditions for the universe, 
but that doesn't prove there is 
no God - only that he acts 
through the laws of 



physics.'- However, 
Hawking definitely did not 
believe in a personal God 
who cares for human beings 
as individuals, relates to them 
in a powerful and 
transforming way, and 
performs miracles. 'We are 
such insignificant creatures 
on a minor planet of a very 
average star in the outer 
suburbs of one of a hundred 
thousand million galaxies. So 



it is difficult to believe in a 
God that would care about us 
or even notice our 
existence.'— Einstein shared 
Hawking' s view. Others, 
including some of Hawking 's 
physics colleagues, would 
agree with Jane Hawking and 
call this a sadly limited view 
of God, pointing out that it's 
equally difficult to believe 
that all the intelligent and 
rational people (a good many 



scientists among them) who 
say they have experienced a 
personal God are somehow 
deluded. This enormous 
difference in outlook could 
hardly have been illustrated 
more strikingly than in the 
views of Stephen and Jane 
Hawking. 

' I used to find Stephen's 
assertion that he doesn't 
believe in a personal God 
quite hurtful,'- Jane 



remembers. She would tell an 
interviewer in 1988: 'He is 
delving into realms that really 
do matter to thinking people 
and in a way that can have a 
very disturbing effect on 
people. There's one aspect of 
his thought that I find 
increasingly upsetting and 
difficult to live with. It's the 
feeling that, because 
everything is reduced to a 
rational, mathematical 



formula, that must be the 
truth.'- It seemed to her that 
there was no room in her 
husband's mind for the 
possibility that the truth 
revealed in his mathematics 
might not be the whole truth. 
A year later she had changed 
her outlook somewhat: 'As 
one grows older it's easier to 
take a broader view. I think 
the whole picture for him is 
so different from the whole 



picture for anybody else by 
virtue of his condition and his 
circumstances ... being an 
almost totally paralysed 
genius ... that nobody else 
can understand what his view 
of God or what his 
relationship with God might 
be.'^ 

Truth might have to be 
mathematical, but physics, for 
Hawking, was not all there 
was to life. 'Physics,' he told 



an interviewer, 'is all very 
well, but it is completely 
cold. I couldn't carry on with 
my life if I only had physics. 
Like everyone else, I need 
warmth, love, and 
affection. '— 

An Unusual Asset 

In the late 1960s it had 
perhaps been generous of 
Hawking 's college and 
university departments to 



keep on a young physicist 
who hadn't long to live, who 
might contribute little to his 
department in terms of 
lecturing and teaching. The 
DAMTP had from the 
beginning exempted Hawking 
from heavy teaching duties 
and allowed him to 
concentrate on his research 
and a few seminars and 
graduate students. By the 
mid-1970s Caius and the 



University had begun to 
realize that they'd done 
themselves a favour. He'd 
become a considerable asset. 

However, at Cambridge 
extraordinary minds and 
personalities aren't 
uncommon. They crop up in 
one university department or 
another on a regular basis. 
It's a healthy environment for 
genius. No matter how much 
one is treated with awe in the 



wider world, within the 
university community it's 
generally just business as 
usual. Even in the late 1970s, 
when Hawking had become 
something of a legend, he and 
all his specialized equipment 
- gadgets to turn pages for 
him, computer terminals with 
special controls so that he 
could use them like a 
blackboard - still shared a 
cramped office with another 



researcher. 

His communication 
problems were growing more 
severe. Earlier in the 1970s it 
was still possible to carry on 
a normal conversation with 
Hawking. However, by the 
late 1970s and early 1980s, 
when his speech was so 
slurred that only his family 
and closest friends could 
understand him, the job of 
'interpreter' frequently fell to 



a research student. Michael 
Harwood, who later 
interviewed Hawking for The 
New York Times, described 
the process: 'Don Page, 
sitting beside him, leans close 
to hear the indistinct words, 
mouths each phrase to be 
certain he has caught it, often 
pauses and asks for a 
repetition, speaks a phrase 
back to Hawking sometimes 
to make certain, corrects 



himself.'— Another 
interviewer recalls that he 
often thought Hawking had 
finished a sentence only to 
find with the 'interpretation' 
that he'd spoken just one 
word. Hawking wrote his 
scientific papers by dictating 
them in this tedious fashion to 
his secretary. But he was 
learning to state ideas in the 
fewest words possible and to 
get to the point in scientific 



papers and conversations. 

What he was saying in 
those few words was 
receiving worldwide 
attention. The procession of 
awards and recognition had 
escalated soon after Hawking 
announced his discovery of 
exploding black holes. In the 
spring of 1974 he was 
inducted into the Royal 
Society, one of the world's 
most prestigious bodies of 



scientists. At thirty-two he 
was young for the honour. 
During the rite of investiture, 
a ceremony dating from the 
seventeenth century, new 
Fellows walk to the podium 
to write their names in a book 
the earliest pages of which 
contain the signature of Isaac 
Newton. Those present when 
Hawking was inducted 
remember that the president 
of the society, Sir Alan 



Hodgkin, Nobel Prize winner 
in biology, broke tradition 
and carried the book down to 
Hawking in the front row. 
Hawking could still write his 
name with great effort, but it 
took him a long time. The 
gathering of eminent 
scientists waited respectfully. 
When Hawking finished and 
looked up with a broad grin, 
they gave him an ovation. 
That same spring, the 



Hawkings enthusiastically 
accepted an invitation from 
the California Institute of 
Technology, where Kip 
Thorne was a professor, to 
spend the academic year 
1974-5 there. 22 Hawking 
would be a Sherman Fairchild 
Distinguished Scholar. The 
offer included an excellent 
salary, a house, a car and 
even a new electric 
wheelchair. All medical 



expenses would be covered 
(the British National Health 
did not cover expenses out of 
the country) as well as 
schooling for Robert and 
Lucy. 

In the spring when that 
offer came, it had been 
almost four years since the 
Hawkings had purchased and 
renovated their house in Little 
St Mary's Lane. Stephen's 
trips up and down the stairs, 



by this time accomplished by 
grasping the posts that held 
up the banister and using only 
the strength of his arms to 
pull himself up step by step to 
the second floor, had for a 
time been good physical 
therapy. They were finally 
proving impossible. Caius 
College chose to be more 
helpful with housing than 
they had been when the 
Hawkings were newly weds. 



There was a new bursar, who 
offered them a spacious 
ground-floor flat in a college- 
owned brick mansion on 
West Road, not far from the 
back gate of King's College. 
The arrangement in this 
house, with a faculty family 
having the rather elegant 
although sometimes a bit run- 
down-around-the-edges lower 
floors, with graduate students 
in rooms above, was not 



unusual at that time in 
Cambridge. The flat Caius 
offered had high ceilings and 
large windows and required 
only a little modification and 
renovation to make it more 
suitable for the family and 
convenient for a wheelchair. 
This work could be 
completed while the 
Hawkings were in California. 
They would be able to move 
in when they returned. Except 



for a gravel parking area in 
front, the house was 
surrounded by gardens tended 
by Caius College gardeners, 
who were also willing to 
listen to suggestions and 
gardening plans from Jane 
Hawking. It would be an 
ideal childhood home for the 
Hawking children. 

Even though he had given 
up on stair climbing, 
Hawking could still feed 



himself and get into and out 
of bed, but these actions too 
were becoming increasingly 
difficult. Jane was still 
managing without outside 
help, working on overdrive to 
try to keep his life as normal 
as it could be with his 
worsening condition, make it 
possible for him to continue 
his work, and at the same 
time see that Robert and Lucy 
weren't robbed of a normal 



childhood. She had also 
occasionally been finding 
time to work on her thesis. 
But the Hawkings both knew 
that something had to change. 

Planning ahead for the 
trip to California, Jane, over 
the Easter holiday, suggested 
a new solution for caring for 
Stephen - one that he could 
accept without feeling it 
represented a concession and 
courage- sapping defeat. They 



would begin a custom of 
asking a graduate student or a 
postdoctoral research student 
to live and travel with them. 
In return for free 
accommodation and extra 
attention from Hawking, the 
student would help him get 
ready for bed and get up. 
When the Hawkings departed 
for California, one of his 
graduate students, Bernard 
Carr, would go with them. 



Jane Hawking booked 
flights and, with Bernard 
Carr's help, packed and 
moved belongings, two small 
children, husband and 
specialized equipment across 
the world to southern 
California with an efficiency 
that awed her friends. 

A Place in the Sun 

In August 1974, Kip Thorne 
met the Hawkings at Los 



Angeles airport in a gleaming 
new American station wagon 
that would be theirs for the 
length of their stay. It had 
been a long flight, over the 
North Pole from London, but 
the family revived in the 
languid air of southern 
California as Kip manoeuvred 
the freeways through the 
sprawling city with its 
skyscrapers and amazingly 
tall palm trees to Pasadena, 



ten miles north-east of 
downtown Los Angeles.- 

They arrived, just at dusk, 
at the house that had been 
arranged for them - a lovely 
home with white weather- 
boarding, lights gleaming in 
every window. The house 
was across the street from the 
Caltech campus and had a 
view of the mountains. Jane 
described it in a letter she 
wrote on that first day to her 



parents back in England: 'It is 
as elegant inside as it is pretty 
out. These people must think 
we are used to an 
astronomical standard of 
living. If only they knew!'— 

Stephen, Jane and their 
children discovered 
hummingbirds on the patio, a 
huge climbable California 
oak tree in the garden, a 
television and several 
bathrooms. There was a 



swimming pool nearby on 
campus. You could easily 
drive to Disneyland. 
Stephen's new, state-of-the- 
art electric wheelchair was 
waiting for him. Like a racing 
car driver testing a new, 
faster, more manoeuvrable 
model, Hawking zoomed 
around, finding out what it 
could do, stopping to allow 
engineers to make 
adjustments. 



As the Hawkings settled 
into their California life, a 
new and rather disturbing 
experience, which they had 
known to expect, was the 
frequent tremors and 
occasionally a rather startling 
earthquake. Their neighbours 
and Hawking 's colleagues at 
Caltech seemed to take these 
in their stride and assured 
Jane and Stephen that small, 
frequent tremors made it less 



likely there would be a big, 
dangerous quake. The house 
and its occupants would make 
it through the year with no 
damage. 

Robert ' s and Lucy ' s 
school was the Pasadena 
Town and Country School. 
Three-year-old Lucy liked it 
so much the first day that she 
made up her mind she would 
stay the full day rather than 
the half-day she was 



assigned. She was nowhere to 
be found when her mother 
came to fetch her. A panicked 
staff discovered Lucy having 
her lunch calmly in the lunch 
room with the older children. 
Robert found a new role, 
making himself invaluable to 
his mother as a master 
navigator of the Los Angeles 
freeways with, seemingly, a 
detailed map in his seven- 
year-old head. Bernard Carr 



dived into Caltech student life 
with a passion and went out 
to parties nearly every 
evening after getting 
Hawking to bed. After the 
parties he sat up the rest of 
the night watching horror 
movies. Fortunately Stephen 
also was not fond of getting 
up early in the morning. 

Jane was caught up in a 
social whirl and the 
Hawkings entertained almost 



constantly. It is rare in the 
Cambridge colleges, with the 
notable exception of Clare 
Hall, for spouses to be nearly 
as much a part of the social 
scene as Jane experienced at 
Caltech. She found the 
change exhilarating, if also a 
little exhausting. In addition 
to new local friends, there 
were visitors from abroad, 
friends and family including 
Jane's parents and Stephen's 



mother and aunt. Stephen's 
sister Philippa visited from 
New York, where she was 
living. The Hawking home, 
so convenient to the campus, 
was the site of frequent 
parties for the Caltech 
Relativity Group. 

The spontaneity and 
directness of Californians 
were a surprise and, to Jane, a 
pleasant change from the 
diffidence and, sometimes, 



outright avoidance she and 
her husband were used to 
encountering in England. It 
was not easy, because of 
Stephen's speech problems, 
for those who did not know 
them well to carry on a 
conversation with the pair of 
them, but Californians 
seemed more than willing to 
try. Stephen Hawking was 
becoming an international 
celebrity in his field when he 



arrived at Caltech and he was, 
accordingly, given star 
treatment. To be fair, had he 
been introduced to 
Cambridge similarly for the 
first time, his and Jane's 
reception in University circles 
might have been 

characterized by some of the 
special attention they 
experienced in Pasadena. 

For an academic taking a 
sabbatical year abroad, the 



time spent away from home is 
often not only an enormous 
boost to his or her creativity 
and intellectual energy, but 
also a watershed for other 
members of the family. So it 
was with the Hawkings. An 
eight-year-old computer-wiz 
friend got Robert excited 
about the field that would 
eventually become his career, 
information technology. 
Another faculty wife invited 



Jane to attend an evening 
choral class that met each 
week to sing through a major 
choral work - Jane's first 
introduction to an avocation 
that would become her 
passion and engage her for 
many years. 

Hawking had an air- 
conditioned office, and ramps 
sprang up all over the Caltech 
campus. He basked in the 
company of other eminent 



researchers and dined as an 
honoured, delighted guest in 
the student 'houses'. The 
California Institute of 
Technology was and is one of 
the greatest centres in the 
world for the study of physics 
and physics research. It is a 
smaller institution than 
Cambridge or Oxford, but the 
faculty includes many of the 
world's most outstanding 
academics, undisputed 



leaders in their fields. For 
Hawking, new colleagues and 
stimulating ideas abounded, 
drawing his interest to areas 
he hadn't explored and to 
fresh ways of approaching the 
problems he was already 
working on. It was here that 
he first met Don Page, then a 
Caltech graduate student, 
who would play a large role 
in the Hawkings' future. Page 
and Hawking wrote a paper 



that year which suggested 
that the explosion of 
primordial black holes might 
be observed as gamma ray 
bursts.- Legendary arch- 
rivals Richard Feynman and 
Murray Gell-Mann were also 
at Caltech, and Hawking 
attended their lectures. Both 
were cutting-edge particle 
physicists, not cosmologists, 
but Hawking was finding 
more and more need for 



expertise in particle physics 
in his study of black holes, 
and here was a priceless 
opportunity. He would soon 
be employing Feynman's idea 
of 'sums-over-histories' in a 
new way as he explored 
possibilities for describing the 
origin of the universe. Jim 
Hartle, whom Hawking had 
met in Cambridge and who 
was at the University of 
California- Santa Barbara, 



spent some time at Caltech 
that year, and he and 
Hawking developed the 
description of Hawking 
radiation discussed in Chapter 

Hawking didn't spend the 
entire year, uninterrupted, in 
Pasadena. Just before 
Christmas he joined his friend 
and colleague George Ellis to 
attend a conference in Dallas, 
and in April he was invited to 



Rome to receive, from Pope 
Paul VI, the Pope Pius XII 
medal, awarded 'to a young 
scientist for distinguished 
work'. Hawking was eager to 
see the document in the 
Vatican Library in which 
Galileo had recanted, under 
extreme pressure and threat 
of torture, his discovery that 
the Earth goes around the 
sun. Hawking took the 
opportunity to lobby for a 



formal apology to Galileo, 
whom the Catholic Church 
had treated so badly three and 
a half centuries before. That 
apology would not be long in 
coming. 

It was in California that 
Hawking began to think 
seriously about a problem 
which would set him at odds 
with some of his colleagues 
for many years: the loss of 
information in black holes. 



We will examine later what 
'information' means in this 
context. For now, think of it 
as information having to do 
with everything that went into 
the making of the black hole 
when it formed and 
everything that has fallen in 
since. How irrevocable is this 
loss? What might it mean for 
our ability to understand the 
universe and make 
predictions? Could it really 



represent the breakdown of 
physics? That was the title he 
gave a paper he wrote that 
year - 'Breakdown of Physics 
in Gravitational Collapse'. 
When it finally appeared in 
November 1976, he had 
changed the title to something 
less shocking, unless you 
stopped to think about it: 
'Breakdown of Predictability 
in Gravitational Collapse'. - 
And, of course, there was 



Kip Thorne, the dear friend 
and colleague who had been 
instrumental in making the 
whole visit possible. Thorne 
and Hawking put their 
signatures (Hawking' s thumb 
print) to a document 
recording their first famous 
bet, about whether the binary 
star system Cygnus X-l 
contains a black hole. 



Penthouse v. Private 



Eye 

The pre-history of Thome's 
and Hawking 's bet began in 
1964, before John Wheeler 
had even coined the name 
black hole. That year Yakov 
Zel'dovich and his graduate 
student Oktay Guseinov at 
the Institute of Applied 
Mathematics in Moscow 
began combing the lists of 
many hundreds of binary star 
systems that astronomers had 



previously observed and 
catalogued. They were 
looking for stars so extremely 
massive and compact that 
they are unlikely to be 
anything but black holes. The 
search for black hole 
candidates had begun, and it 
was no straightforward 
undertaking. Such candidates 
are, by nature, invisible to an 
optical telescope. 

In order to understand 



what binary star systems are 
and why they are good places 
to look for black holes, 
picture a scene described by 
John Wheeler. In a dimly lit 
ballroom, the women are all 
dressed in white gowns. 
Some of the men are also 
dressed in white, but a few of 
them are in black formal 
attire. Watching the couples 
waltz, from a balcony above, 
we know there are two people 



in each pair, but in some 
cases we can see only one of 
them, the woman in white. 

A binary star system 
consists of two stars circling 
one another, as the man and 
woman in one of Wheeler's 
couples do. In some binary 
systems, only one star is 
visible. How do we know that 
there are two stars? In the 
ballroom, by watching how 
the visible woman moves, it's 



fairly obvious that she must 
have a partner. Likewise, by 
studying the movement of 
some stars, it is possible to 
conclude that they are not 
alone out there. 

Seeing a star apparently 
alone but moving as though it 
has a partner does not always 
signify a black hole. The 
invisible companion might be 
a small, dim, low-temperature 
star - a white dwarf, or a 



neutron star. Calculating the 
mass of such stars is 
complicated, and mass is a 
vital statistic when you're 
trying to determine whether 
something is a black hole or 
not. Suffice it to say that, 
again, this was information 
that astronomers in the 1960s 
were beginning to find 
ingenious ways to glean from 
the movements of the visible 
star. 



In 1966, Zel'dovich and 
another colleague, Igor 
Novikov, decided that 
identifying strong black hole 
candidates would require 
using both optical telescopes 
and X-ray detectors. The 
observation of X-rays 
indicates a source of 
considerable energy powering 
their emission, and having 
material fall towards a black 
hole or neutron star is one of 



the best ways known to 
liberate energy. In a binary 
system, that is what happens 
when the very compact star or 
black hole pulls material 
away from its companion 
star. So researchers looked 
for binary systems where one 
partner shows up brightly in 
the visible part of the 
spectrum but is dark in the X- 
ray part; while the other 
partner is dark in the visible 



part of the spectrum but 
bright in the X-ray part. 

Cygnus X-l was a very 
promising candidate. Here 
was a binary system where an 
optically bright but X-ray 
dark star orbits with an 
optically dark but X-ray 
bright companion. This 
system is in our galaxy, about 
6,000 light years from Earth. 
The two stars complete one 
orbit in 5.6 days. An optical 



telescope reveals what seems 
to be a blue giant star, too 
dim to be detected with the 
naked eye. Studies of the 
Doppler shift in its light show 
that it must have a 
companion. Cygnus X-l is 
that companion. It can't be 
seen at all with an optical 
telescope, but it is one of the 
brightest objects in the X-ray 
sky. The X-ray emission 
fluctuates violently and 



chaotically, as expected when 
matter falls towards a black 
hole or neutron star. Cygnus 
X-l's mass is at a minimum 3 
solar masses, probably 
greater than 7 solar masses, 
and most likely about 1 6 solar 
masses. In December 1974, 
such uncertainty in 
calculations of its mass made 
the Hawking-Thorne bet 
possible. Cygnus X-l was an 
excellent black hole 



candidate, but experts were 
only about 80 per cent certain 
that it was a black hole and 
not a neutron star. 

The bet document laid out 
the terms: If Cygnus X-l 
turned out to be a black hole, 
Hawking would give Thorne 
a one-year subscription to the 
magazine Penthouse. If it 
turned out not to be a black 
hole, Thorne would give 
Hawking a four-year 



subscription to Private Eye. 
Hawking called his surprising 
bet against Cygnus X- 1 being 
a black hole an 'insurance 
policy'. 'I have done a lot of 
work on black holes, and it 
would all be wasted if it 
turned out that black holes do 
not exist. But in that case, I 
would have the consolation of 
winning my bet.' The bet 
document was framed and 
hung on the wall of Thome's 



office at Caltech, awaiting the 
advancement of science. 

Sadly, as the year in 
California approached its end, 
the feelings of depression, 
inadequacy and low self- 
esteem that had plagued Jane 
back in Cambridge caught up 
with her again. She began to 
reassess the social whirl of 
that year in Pasadena and 
view it as a sort of frenzied 
escapism from these 



problems. She felt she had 
fallen easy prey to the 
women ' s liberation 
movement's insistence that a 
woman who had no job 
outside her home should 
consider herself a failure, 
lacking in personal 
fulfilment.- Jane concluded 
this was indeed the prevalent 
feeling among unemployed 
faculty wives she had met. 
Excursions with them to art 



museums and galleries and 
plays now seemed only the 
sad, kindly attempts of these 
women to make up for the 
bleakness of their lives and 
hers. A thoughtful and 
discerning friend, recognizing 
Jane for the remarkable 
woman she was, and perhaps 
sensing that she was not 
capable of recognizing this 
herself, gave her a pearl 
brooch on the day that 



Stephen Hawking was 
awarded his Papal medal, 
saying that she, Jane, should 
be given something too.- 



8 



'Scientists usually 
assume there is a 

unique link between 
the past and the future, 

cause and effect. If 
information is lost, this 

link does not exist' 



back in Cambridge after their 
sojourn in California, the 
Hawkings settled into their 
new home in West Road. 1 For 
Stephen, after a year in an 
electric wheelchair that could 
move fast and be used both 
indoors and out, there was no 
going back to an old- 
fashioned model. His request 
to the UK Department of 
Health for a chair like the one 
he'd had in California was 



rejected. The Hawkings 
drained their savings to 
purchase it themselves. 

In this new vehicle, the 
daily journey to the DAMTP 
in Silver Street took about ten 
minutes, not by the shortest 
route but by a more pleasant 
and less-trafficked one. He 
followed a curving tree-lined 
footpath through King's 
College that took him across 
the 'Backs' past meadows 



with grazing cows and 
immaculately mown lawns, 
crossing the River Cam by a 
hump-backed stone bridge 
behind King's College 
Chapel. From there he had a 
choice. He could use a side 
entrance from King's and, by 
way of a not heavily used 
back street called Queens' 
Lane, pass in the shadow of 
the towering medieval gates 
of Queens' College to arrive 



at Silver Street. Or he could 
exit King's by its main front 
gate into busy King's Parade, 
and then turn right to reach 
Silver Street. Either way, the 
hazardous crossing of this 
narrow, busy thoroughfare 
provided a modicum of risk 
and excitement to climax an 
otherwise peaceful journey. 
Around the back of his 
building was his ramp. He 
would time his arrival for 



about 11 a.m. Hawking 's new 
graduate student assistant, 
Alan Lapades, sometimes 
made the journey with him, 
but often Hawking went on 
his own, the state-of-the-art 
wheelchair giving him 
optimum independence. 

By the autumn of 1975, 
Hawking had completed the 
six years of his Caius 
Fellowship for Distinction in 
Science. Though he couldn't 



lecture, he was a very good 
mentor, willing to spend so 
much time in discussion with 
his students that some 
colleagues wondered how he 
ever got his own work done. 
The University of Cambridge 
put an end to rumours 
circulating that he might 
emigrate permanently to the 
USA by offering him a 
'readership' and also a 
secretary, Judy Fella. Judy 



was a vivacious and rather 
glamorous addition to the 
DAMTP and a godsend to 
both Stephen and Jane. His 
having his own secretary 
relieved Jane of the burden of 
doing all Hawking 's 
scheduling and travel 
bookings. Jane turned once 
again to her neglected thesis 
and, following up on her new 
musical interest, began voice 
lessons.- 



In the summer of 1975, 
BBC television lorries 
lumbered into the Hawkings' 
West Road forecourt and 
snaked cables into the house 
to film Stephen for a 
documentary, The Key to the 
Universe, moving to Silver 
Street to film a seminar in the 
DAMTP. Media invasions 
such as this, which would 
happen many times in the 
future, ran roughshod over 



other interests and priorities 
of colleagues, students, staff 
and family. Over the years it 
would become an annoyance, 
but the first few times it was 
very exciting. 

Jane's plan of having 
live-in student assistants was 
working well. Hawking was 
eager for Don Page, whom he 
had met at Caltech, to come 
to fill that position. Page, who 
was finishing his Ph.D. and 



applying for postdoc posts, 
was a close friend and an 
extremely promising physics 
colleague. When Gary 
Gibbons was invited to 
Munich for a year, that freed 
funds to hire Page as 
Research Assistant. Later, a 
NATO fellowship would pay 
him. In autumn 1976, this 
unusually tall young man 
with a powerfully resonant 
speaking voice joined the 



West Road household. 

For Hawking, an agnostic 
bordering on atheism, Don 
was an unexpected choice - 
intellectually brilliant, 
scrupulously moral, devoutly 
and outspokenly religious. He 
would not stick to physics 
topics on journeys to and 
from Silver Street but often 
veered off into discussions of 
what he had read in the Bible 
that morning. Stephen parried 



with friendly sceptical banter 
but respected Don's opinions 
and faith. Don would remain 
a personal friend and a highly 
valued academic collaborator 
long after his student 
assistantship was over. 

With Judy Fella at the 
office and Don Page at home, 
some of the responsibility for 
Stephen was off Jane 
Hawking 's shoulders. For the 
first time in many years, 



Stephen travelled without her, 
in the summer of 1977, when 
Page accompanied him on a 
revisit to Caltech lasting 
several weeks. 

It was about this time that 
Hawking and other younger 
Fellows were invited to come 
to London for Prince 
Charles's induction into the 
Royal Society. The prince 
was intrigued by Hawking 's 
wheelchair, and Hawking, 



twirling it around to 
demonstrate its capabilities, 
carelessly ran over Prince 
Charles's toes. Soon rumour 
had it that running over toes 
was not always accidental, 
and eventually it would get 
around that one of Hawking' s 
regrets in life was not having 
an opportunity to run over 
Margaret Thatcher's toes. 
People who annoyed him, it 
was said, found themselves a 



target. 'A malicious rumour,' 
insists Hawking. 'I'll run over 
anyone who repeats it.'- 

In the autumn of 1977, 
just two years after his 
'readership' began, the 
University of Cambridge 
promoted Hawking to a chair 
in gravitational physics, with 
a welcome rise in salary. He 
was now a 'professor', a 
distinction much more rarely 
achieved at Cambridge and 



most English universities than 
in an American one. 

It was that December of 
1977, when Jane joined the 
choir of St Mark's Church in 
Barton Road for the 
Christmas season of special 
music, that she first met a 
young man named Jonathan 
Hellyer Jones, who was the 
organist there. Jonathan was a 
gifted musician, younger than 
Jane and Stephen by a few 



years. He had recently lost his 
wife to leukaemia after only 
one year of marriage. The 
Hawking home became a 
haven for him. Both Jane and 
Stephen were emotional 
supports, but Jonathan also 
more than pulled his own 
weight in the household - 
sitting at the piano teaching 
seven-year-old Lucy, and 
volunteering to help with 
Stephen's physical needs. 



Jane joined the St Mark's 
congregation. She also was at 
last able to find the time to 
begin working seriously on 
the final chapter of her 
thesis. 4 

Perhaps it was inevitable 
that this young man, 
intimately and generously 
involved with the family, a 
godsend to Jane as she 
struggled to keep up with her 
tasks as caregiver, 



homemaker, Ph.D. student 
and mother, and sharing her 
faith and her love of music, 
would become more than a 
helpful supportive friend. 
Jane, with characteristic 
honesty, did not keep it a 
secret from Stephen when she 
and Jonathan developed a 
romantic attachment. 
Hawking apparently accepted 
this, saying nothing except 
that, as Jane has written, 'he 



would not object so long as I 
continued to love him'.- After 
that, the subject was rarely 
mentioned between them, and 
Jane's relationship with 
Jonathan remained platonic 
for a long time. They chose 
'to maintain our code of 
conduct in front of Stephen 
and the children, suppressing 
displays of close affection'. 
They did not move out to live 
together. 'Jonathan and I had 



struggled with our own 
consciences and decided that 
the greater good - the 
survival of the family unit, 
Stephen's right to live at 
home within that family unit 
and welfare of the children - 
outweighed the importance of 
our relationship.'- Their 
secret was so well guarded 
that only a small circle of 
family and friends were 
aware of that relationship, 



and whatever grief Jane and 
Jonathan may, or may not, 
have caused him, Hawking 
kept that to himself. 2 

In the autumn of 1978 
Jane was pregnant again. 
With not only Don Page and 
Judy Fella but also Jonathan 
on board, she decided to set 
herself a deadline for 
finishing her thesis before the 
baby was born in the spring. 
It was now or never. In the 



winter she set that work aside 
only briefly to organize a 
charity concert to raise funds 
for the newly formed Motor 
Neurone Disease Association. 
Stephen was a patron. Jane 
was beginning to be a 
presence in the music world 
of Cambridge. - 

The Hawkings' third 
child, Timothy, was born in 
April on Easter Sunday. To 
commemorate another 



birthday a hundred years 
before, Hawking and Werner 
Israel celebrated the 
anniversary of the birth of 
Albert Einstein (14 March 
1879) by inviting colleagues 
to contribute articles to a 
book reflecting current 
research related to general 
relativity. The introduction 
foreshadowed the topic of 
Hawking 's Inaugural Lecture 
as Lucasian Professor, 



commenting on 'Einstein's 
dream of a complete and 
consistent theory that would 
unify all the laws of 
physics'. 2 

Hawking received several 
major international awards 
and honorary doctorates in 
the mid- to late 1970s, 
including the Hughes Medal 
from the Royal Society 
honouring 'an original 
discovery in the physical 



sciences' for 'distinguished 
contributions to the 
application of general 
relativity to astrophysics', 
and, in 1978, the coveted 
Albert Einstein Award from 
the Lewis and Rosa Strauss 
Memorial Fund in the United 
States. That award is not 
given every year and is the 
most prestigious American 
award for a physicist. One of 
the honorary doctorates, in 



the summer of 1978, was 
from his alma mater, Oxford. 
Most significant of all for 
Hawking 's future, in the 
autumn of 1979 the 
University of Cambridge 
gave him the venerable title 
of Lucasian Professor of 
Mathematics. He at last got a 
private office. The impressive 
tome in which each new 
university teaching officer 
inscribes his or her name was 



brought to him there more 
than a year later. Somehow, 
this formality had been 
neglected earlier. ' I signed 
with great difficulty. That 
was the last time I signed my 
name.'— 

In 1980, Hawking's battle 
for independence reached a 
crisis point. Martin Rees was 
by then the holder of another 
prestigious chair at 
Cambridge, the Plumian 



Professorship of Astronomy. 
He had known the Hawkings 
since before their marriage 
and had witnessed at close 
hand both Stephen's soaring 
success as a scientist and his 
inexorable physical decline. 
Some time in the late winter 
or early spring Rees asked 
Jane to come in for a chat 
with him at the Institute of 
Physics. Earlier that winter, 
when a bad cold had turned 



more serious and Jane had 
also been ill and slow to 
mend, Stephen, on the family 
doctor's recommendation, 
had entered a nursing home 
for a short while until they 
both recovered. Rees feared 
that this would be the first of 
many times when the 
Hawkings would not be able 
to cope without additional 
help. He offered to find 
funding to pay for limited 



home nursing.— 

To Hawking, this was 
unthinkable. Agreeing to it 
would be giving in to his 
illness and would introduce 
an unwelcome, impersonal 
intrusion into his life. He 
would become a patient. 
After some consideration, 
however, he changed his 
mind. There would be 
advantages. He would be 
much freer to travel, not 



always having to depend on 
his wife, friends and students. 
What he had at first seen as a 
loss of independence might 
be a gain instead. 

N=8 Supergravity 

Hawking ' s Inaugural 
Lucasian Lecture, 'Is the End 
in Sight for Theoretical 
Physics?', with which this 
book began, took place on 29 
April 1980. In that lecture he 



chose N=8 supergravity as 
the front-running candidate 
for the Theory of Everything. 
It was not one of his own 
theories, but it seemed to him 
and many other physicists 
extremely promising. 
Supergravity grew out of the 
idea of supersymmetry, a 
theory that suggested that all 
the particles we know have 
supersymmetric partners, 
particles with the same mass 



but different 'spin'. 

In A Brief History of 
Time, Hawking suggests it's 
best to think of spin as 
meaning what a particle looks 
like when you rotate it. A 
particle with spin 0 is like a 
dot. It looks the same no 
matter from what direction 
you look at it and no matter 
how you turn it. A particle 
with spin 1 is like an arrow: 
you have to turn it around a 



full rotation (360 degrees) to 
have it look the same as when 
you started. A particle with 
spin 2 is like an arrow with 
two heads (one at each end of 
the shaft): it will look the 
same if you turn it only half a 
rotation (180 degrees). All 
seems fairly straightforward 
so far, but now we come to 
something slightly more 
bizarre, particles with spin Vi. 
These have to complete two 



rotations in order to return to 
their original configuration. 

We saw in Chapter 2 that 
every particle we know in the 
universe is either a fermion 
(particles that make up 
matter) or a boson (a 
'messenger' particle). 
Elementary fermions have 
spin Vi. An electron, for 
example, has to finish two 
rotations in order to return to 
its original configuration. 



Bosons, on the other hand, all 
have whole number spins. 
The photon, W and Z bosons, 
and the gluon have spin 1, 
returning to their original 
configuration after one 
rotation (the single-headed 
arrow). The graviton 
theoretically has spin 2 (the 
double-headed arrow), 
returning to its original 
configuration after half a 
rotation. 



Supersymmetry theory 
suggests a unification of 
matter and the forces of 
nature by proposing 
'supersymmetric partners' for 
each of these particles, with 
every fermion having a boson 
for a partner, and every boson 
a fermion - a little like the 
procession at the end of an 
old-fashioned wedding 
uniting two formerly 
incompatible families, with 



every bridesmaid going out 
on the arm of a groom's 
attendant from the other clan. 
There was a Latin flavour to 
the naming of the bosons' 
partners. The photon's 
theoretical supersymmetric 
partner was christened the 
photino. The graviton's was 
named the gravitino. As for 
the fermions, their 
supersymmetric partners were 
all given names by adding an 



s. And so we have the 
selectron and the squark. 

There were several 
versions of supergravity 
around at the time of 
Hawking' s Lucasian Lecture. 
N=8 supergravity had the 
advantage of being the only 
one that worked in four 
dimensions (three of space 
and one of time), and though 
it called for a goodly number 
of as yet undiscovered 



particles, it did not call for an 
infinite number of them, as 
other attempts at theories of 
quantum gravity did. The 
name N=8 came from the fact 
that in this theory the graviton 
had not just one but eight 
supersymmetric partners. A 
little awkward for processing 
down the aisle, but it worked 
well in the theory. 

It was not long after his 
Lucasian Lecture that 



Hawking and others realized 
how stupendously difficult it 
was to do any calculations 
using what had seemed to be 
such a promising theory. In 
addition to the graviton and 
the eight gravitinos, there 
were 154 types of particles. 
The general conclusion was 
that it would take about four 
years to finish a calculation, 
even if you used a computer - 
making sure to account for all 



the particles, searching for 
infinities that might still lurk 
somewhere, and being sure 
not to make an error! 

Another problem was that 
none of the supersymmetric 
partners had ever been 
observed or looked likely to 
be. The theory says they have 
the same mass as their 
'normal' partners, but this 
symmetry (in the world we 
can observe) is 'broken', 



leaving the supersymmetric 
partners hundreds, even 
thousands of times more 
massive. The energy required 
to discover them in a lab is 
tremendous . ' Symmetry- 
breaking' is something we'll 
return to in another context. 

The 'Higgs field', 
proposed in 1964 by Peter 
Higgs at the University of 
Edinburgh, theoretically 
pervades the entire universe 



and is responsible for the 
symmetry-breaking that 
makes the supersymmetric 
partners so difficult to 
discover experimentally, and 
also for the masses of more 
familiar particles. If the 
theory is right, the Higgs field 
should show up as the 'Higgs 
particle', with spin 0. The 
Higgs particle itself is very 
massive and has never been 
observed, but, if it indeed 



exists, it may be discoverable 
with the high energies of the 
Large Hadron Collider at 
CERN on the Swiss-French 
border at Geneva. One of 
Hawking 's famous bets is 
that the Higgs particle will 
not turn up at all. He has 
become more interested in the 
possibility that the LHC may 
discover some of the 
supersymmetric partners, or 
perhaps produce a mini-black 



hole. 

In the spring of 1980, 
when Hawking gave his 
Lucasian Lecture, Jane was 
working towards her doctoral 
oral examination, scheduled 
for June. No one was 
surprised when she passed. 
She would not be officially 
graduated until April 1981, 
but with her degree now a 
certainty, she began to tutor 
local children in French, and 



then took a part-time position 
at the Cambridge Centre for 
Sixth Form Studies, helping 
students prepare for their 
sixth-form examinations and 
gain entrance to university.- 
A little later, degree in hand, 
she became a teacher at sixth- 
form level. The beginning of 
her professional career was 
something of an anticlimax 
after her years of labour to 
finish her thesis. There was 



still a dispiriting gap between 
her own considerable 
intellectual achievements and 
the much more conspicuous 
success of her husband. 
Nevertheless, 'It is fulfilling a 
part of me,' she said, 'that I 
feel has been suppressed for a 
long time and the marvellous 
thing is that it is totally 
compatible with what goes on 
at home.'- 

Tim was a toddler, Robert 



was thriving at the Perse 
School, and Lucy had become 
a favourite at her primary 
school. The first I ever heard 
of any of the Hawkings was a 
comment from the head 
teacher at Newnham Croft 
Primary School that my six- 
year-old daughter reminded 
her of Lucy Hawking. This 
was obviously meant as a 
compliment. When I met 
Lucy, I found that it was. She 



by then had finished at the 
school but was back for a 
visit, helping with the small 
children in the playground. A 
radiant, clean-cut, blonde 
sixteen-year-old, she was 
brimming with intelligence 
and personality, with a 
thoughtfulness and 
composure beyond her years. 
She said her father was a 
physicist at Cambridge, but 
she hoped to go to Oxford 



instead because she had lived 
in Cambridge all her life and 
wanted a change of scene. 
Lucy told interviewers that 
she was not like her father. ' I 
was never any good at 
science. I even managed to be 
hopeless at maths as well, 
which was slightly 
embarrassing.'- But she was 
a fine student and cellist. It's 
unlikely anyone has ever 
wagered a bag of sweets 



against her success or that of 
her brothers. 

Trouble in the Attic 

The year spent at the 
California Institute of 
Technology in 1974-5 had 
been such a success from 
Stephen Hawking 's point of 
view and that of his hosts that 
he began a habit of returning 
for a month almost every 
year. Caltech renewed and 



extended his Sherman 
Fairchild Distinguished 
Scholar appointment to make 
this possible. 

By 1980, Kip Thorne had 
noticed a change in 
Hawking 's attitude towards 
his research, summed up 
when Hawking told him: 'I 
would rather be right than 
rigorous.' This rather 
enigmatic statement referred 
to the fact that most 



mathematicians are satisfied 
with nothing less than a firm 
mathematical proof that they 
are correct. That had been 
Hawking 's attitude in the 
1960s and 1970s. Now he 
was saying that such rigour is 
not necessarily the best way 
to arrive at 'right'. It could 
lead one not to see the forest 
for the trees. He had become 
more speculative, happy to be 
perhaps 95 per cent sure of 



something and then move on. 
'Stubbornly intuitive' was 
how New York Times 
columnist Dennis Overbye 
described him.- Though 
Hawking 's intuition was 
often on target, for him the 
quest for certainty had 
changed to a quest for 'high 
probability and rapid 
movement towards the 
ultimate goal of 

understanding the nature of 



the uni verse '.— 

Hawking 's experience of 
California had broadened to 
include more than Los 
Angeles and Pasadena. He 
liked the steep streets of San 
Francisco and the 
opportunities they offered for 
a dare-devil in a motorized 
wheelchair. He was just as 
reckless a driver now as he 
had been when he took Jane 
Wilde to the Trinity Hall May 



Ball in 1963. His colleague 
Leonard Susskind remembers 
him poised at the top of the 
steepest section of one of 
those hills, with an incline so 
severe that motorists shudder, 
fearing that their brakes must 
surely fail or the car 
somersault forward. Hawking 
flashed his companions one 
of his mischievous smiles and 
then disappeared, barrelling 
down the hill, almost in free 



fall. When they caught up 
with him at the bottom he 
was sitting there grinning 
with satisfaction and asked 
them to take him to a steeper 
hill. 12 

In San Francisco in 1981, 
Hawking called attention to 
an issue that troubled some of 
his colleagues far more than 
his reckless disregard for the 
hazards of San Francisco 
streets. The venue was more 



than eccentric, the attic of the 
mansion of Werner Erhard, 
founder of a pop psychology 
called EST. EST targeted 
people who felt they were 
sadly lacking in self- 
confidence and were willing 
to pay fees of several hundred 
dollars for help. As many as a 
thousand at a time gathered 
for intensive two-week 
sessions in hotel ballrooms to 
submit to therapy that could 



be authoritarian, demeaning, 
and verbally and physically 
abusive. The claim was that 
they would experience at 
least temporarily a personal 
transformation and emerge 
enlightened, self-confident 
and outgoing. For some, it 
worked. 

This scheme had made a 
fortune for Erhard. He was 
also a physics aficionado and 
he used his wealth to cultivate 



the friendship of a number of 
theoretical physicists at the 
top of their profession and not 
at all lacking in self- 
confidence, including Richard 
Feynman. Erhard hosted 
elaborate gourmet dinners for 
them and equipped his 
mansion's attic to 
accommodate small, 
exclusive physics 
conferences, funded out of his 
pocket. Though Erhard was 



the founding father of what 
his critics regarded as a 
hokey, violent pop 
psychology, he was a 
pleasant, interesting, 
extremely intelligent man. 
The elite of physics chose to 
ignore the first persona and 
enjoy the second, and did not 
say no to what he offered 
them.— 

When Stephen Hawking 
made his announcement at a 



conference in 1981 in 
Erhard's attic, he was still 
able to speak with his own 
voice, but it had been several 
years since anyone except 
those who knew him best 
could understand him. His 
interpreter on this occasion 
was Martin Rocek, then a 
Junior Research Fellow at the 
DAMTP, later to make his 
name in physics in the areas 
of string theory and 



supersymmetry. Rocek 
travelled with Hawking on 
that trip to California, 
struggling more or less 
successfully to understand 
him and repeat his words 
clearly for others. Film clips 
made of this process show 
what a prodigious effort was 
involved. For most lectures, 
such as his Lucasian Lecture, 
Hawking 's graduate assistant 
would deliver the talk and 



'[Hawking] would just sit 
around and add brief 
comments if a student would 
say something wrong'. - 
Whatever the Byzantine 
nature of the process 
involved, Hawking ' s 

announcement in Erhard's 
attic was clear enough. 

He had been focusing his 
attention on black holes for 
about fifteen years, arriving at 
equations of such simple 



clarity and elegance that he 
felt they had to be correct. 
Such results, he insisted, 
reveal a deep harmony 
underlying nature.- By 1981, 
hardly anyone was treating 
Hawking radiation as a 
dubious concept. But 
Hawking had begun to 
realize, at least as early as his 
sabbatical in Pasadena in 
1974-5, that at the heart of 
the equations surrounding 



that discovery lurked a 
paradox that threatened to 
undermine the whole of 
physics. It had to do with the 
loss of information in black 
holes and the threat this posed 
to a fundamental tenet of 
physics, the law of 
information conservation: 
information can never be lost 
from the universe. Don Page, 
in 1979, had been the first to 
disagree with Stephen's 



conclusion, but Stephen had 
not budged. 

It's important to 
understand what 
'information' means in this 
context. You can think of this 
lost information as 
information about everything 
that went into making the 
black hole in the first place 
and everything that fell in 
later. But what does a 
theoretical physicist mean by 



'information'? The clue is in 
the words 'information 
encoded in the particles that 
make up the universe'. 

Here, from the history of 
the study of black holes, is an 
example that helps explain 
what 'information' means to 
a theoretical physicist: in his 
book The Black Hole War, 
Leonard Susskind tells of an 
Einstein-like thought 
experiment performed by 



Jacob Bekenstein when he 
was considering the question 
of the entropy of a black hole. 
(Bekenstein' s proposals, you 
will recall, presented a 
challenge to Stephen 
Hawking in 1972.) It's hard 
to imagine that anything 
could take much less 
information into a black hole 
than a single photon falling 
in, but, in fact, one photon 
does carry a good deal of 



information. Most 
significantly for Bekenstein, 
it carries into the black hole 
information about the 
location where it fell in. 

Bekenstein wanted to 
consider a smaller amount of 
information than that for his 
thought experiment. He 
wanted to reduce the amount 
of information to one 'bit', a 
unit of information suggested 
by John Wheeler that has the 



smallest possible size in the 
universe - a quantum 
distance calculated by Max 
Planck in the early twentieth 
century. In order to achieve 
this, Bekenstein made use of 
Heisenberg ' s uncertainty 
principle and imagined 
'smearing out' the location 
where the photon fell in. He 
imagined a photon of such 
long wavelength that the 
probability of its entry point 



would be spread out over the 
entire event horizon, making 
it as uncertain as possible, so 
that it would convey only a 
single 'bit' of information - 
that the photon was, in fact, 
inside the black hole. The 
photon's presence would add 
to the mass of the black hole 
and, of course, to the area of 
the event horizon, by a 
minuscule amount, which 
Bekenstein proceeded to 



calculate. 

Obviously, 'information' 
in this story means something 
a little more subtle than what 
you and I normally think of 
as everyday 'information'. It 
isn't only information such as 
what channel John Wheeler's 
television was tuned to when 
it fell into the black hole. 

The idea of information 
disappearing into a black hole 
and becoming inaccessible to 



those on the outside was not 
new to anyone at the 
conference. Locked-away 
information like that is not a 
violation of information 
conservation. The 
information in a black hole 
may be inaccessible to 
anyone on the outside, but it 
is still in the universe. 
Hawking was thinking of 
something more drastic. 
When a black hole has finally 



radiated all of its mass away 
and disappeared, what has 
actually happened to 
everything that went into 
forming the black hole and 
everything that later fell in? 

If you have been 
following this book carefully, 
you may be raising your hand 
to suggest that it would all 
have been recycled as 
Hawking radiation. That 
radiation, of course, would 



not look anything like, say, a 
hapless astronaut who fell in, 
but could it somehow be the 
solution to the problem? 
After all, the law of 
information conservation has 
it that information encoded in 
the particles of which 
everything in the universe is 
made up can be scrambled, 
chopped up, destroyed, but if 
the fundamental laws of 
physics as we now 



understand them are correct, 
it can always be retrieved 
from the particles that make it 
up. In principle, with the 
information in hand, anything 
can be restored.- 

For example, let's say you 
burned this book. You might 
think you would never be 
able to finish reading it. 
However, in principle, if you 
could study the burning 
process carefully enough to 



trace all the molecular 
interactions that turned the 
book to ashes, then by 
running the process 
backwards you could have 
the book again. It would be a 
lot easier to go out and buy 
another copy, but in principle 
you could reconstruct it- 
Hawking would have 
none of that. He insisted that 
Hawking radiation could not 
serve as the escape vehicle 



back into the outside universe 
for information trapped in a 
black hole. If you tossed this 
book into a black hole, such 
reconstruction would be 
impossible. Hawking 
radiation is not the 'ashes' or 
the scrambled or chopped-up 
remains of what fell into the 
black hole. Recall that the 
'escaping' member of the 
particle pair in Hawking 
radiation (the way it was 



explained in Chapter 6 ) 
doesn't come from inside the 
black hole. It comes from just 
outside. The escaping particle 
carries with it no news 
whatsoever about whether the 
black hole is full of 
astronauts, unmatched socks, 
or Winnie the Pooh's 
grandmother's honeypot. It 
doesn't know. Hawking 
radiation has no direct 
connection to whatever went 



into forming the black hole in 
the first place or what has 
fallen in. There are some 
physicists who held out hope 
that such information is 
somehow encoded in the 
Hawking radiation, but 
Hawking was not one of 
them. He thought that 
information does not escape 
and is completely lost when 
the black hole evaporates. 
You can't restore it, not even 



in principle. Hawking 
christened the dilemma he 
had raised 'the information 
paradox'. 

The problem looked 
likely to extend beyond black 
holes. In an interview on the 
BBC programme Horizon in 
2005, Leonard Susskind, who 
was there in Erhard's attic, 
remembers his shock at 
Hawking 's arguments and the 
realization that if Hawking 



was right - if information 
really is irretrievably lost in 
black holes - then that is not 
the only place it is going to be 
lost. Pieces of the universe 
must be missing. We can 
forget about predictability. 
Forget the dependability of 
cause and effect. Nothing we 
think we know in science can 
be trusted.- 

Hawking perceived that 
Susskind was probably the 



only person present who fully 
realized the implications of 
his arguments. 'Leonard 
Susskind got very upset,' he 
remembers. Scientists, and 
the rest of us, rely on the link 
between past and future, 
between cause and effect. 
That link is lost if information 
is lost. 'We wouldn't be able 
to predict the future. We can't 
be sure of our past history 
either. The history books and 



our memories could be just 
illusions. It is the past that 
tells us who we are. Without 
it we lose our identity.'- Kip 
Thorne pointed out that there 
was already speculation about 
the existence of black holes 
that are smaller than atoms 
that could be anywhere and 
everywhere, nibbling away 
bits of information.— 

The problem may not 
seem so disastrous to you or 



me. Granted, when anything 
falls into a black hole it 
carries information with it. 
The colour and size of a few 
unmatched socks? Perhaps 
the dimensions of the 
unfortunate astronaut? Not 
information that you or I find 
interesting or essential. 
However, this information is 
necessary, even for a more 
limited kind of prediction 
allowed by quantum 



mechanics. 

Hawking traces the 
discussion about being able to 
predict the future or the past 
to Pierre- Simon de Laplace, a 
mathematician who lived in 
the late eighteenth and early 
nineteenth centuries. 
Laplace's famous proposal 
was that an omniscient being 
with unlimited powers of 
calculation, knowing the laws 
of the universe and the state 



of everything in it (that is, the 
positions and momenta of all 
the particles in the universe) 
at any given time, would be 
able to calculate the state of 
everything in the universe at 
any other time in the past or 
future. Though no one denied 
the stupefying practical 
difficulties of acquiring such 
knowledge and doing all the 
calculations, Laplace-style 
scientific determinism 



remained dogma through the 
nineteenth and early twentieth 
centuries. When I heard 
Hawking lecturing on the 
subject in Cambridge, he 
quoted Laplace in French and 
told us that since we were a 
Cambridge audience he 
would not insult our 
intelligence by offering a 
translation. One nevertheless 
soon slyly appeared on his 
slide screen. 



Laplace's omniscient 
being had to have knowledge 
of the positions and momenta 
of all particles in the 
universe. You can't leave out 
the particles in the toe of the 
sock. When the sock falls into 
the black hole, that 
information is lost from our 
region of the universe. If 
black holes exist for ever, 
well and good, then the lost 
information isn't entirely lost. 



It is inaccessible, but still 
there. If black holes evaporate 
and disappear from the 
universe . . . trouble. 

Hawking and his 
colleagues in the attic knew 
that the 'information paradox' 
was not the first challenge to 
Laplace-style scientific 
determinism. In the mid- 
19208 when Werner 
Heisenberg published his 
'uncertainty principle', it 



seemed all bets must be off 
... but only for a while. 
Arguments having to do with 
interpretations and 
implications of the 
uncertainty principle would 
go on for years and involve 
the finest minds in physics, 
but by the time Hawking 
studied black holes there was 
fairly general agreement that 
even Laplace's omniscient 
being could not possibly 



know precisely a particle's 
position and momentum at 
the same time. 

The uncertainty principle 
did not, however, ultimately 
succeed in undermining faith 
in the dogma of scientific 
determinism. It soon became 
clear that laws governing the 
quantum level of the universe 
are deterministic in a different 
way. You can predict what is 
called the 'quantum state', 



from which both positions 
and momenta can be 
calculated with a certain 
degree of accuracy. Laplace's 
omniscient being, knowing 
the quantum state of the 
universe at any one moment 
in time, and the laws of 
science, could predict the 
quantum state of the universe 
at any other time, past or 
future.-fnl 

Now, Hawking had found 



a new problem, and it seemed 
to be a serious one. His 
earlier work had shown that 
black holes don't last for 
ever. As Hawking radiation 
continues, the black hole gets 
smaller until eventually there 
is no black hole left. He was 
insisting that the information 
about whatever went into 
forming the black hole in the 
first place, and whatever fell 
in, is then irretrievably lost. 



Still ... why all the angst 
about its loss? Couldn't the 
universe make do with a little 
less of this rather arcane 
information? 

No, it seems it cannot. 
Not and still be the universe 
we think we know. The law 
of information conservation is 
one of the fundamental 
principles of physics. 
Information is never lost. It 
can be mixed and scrambled 



and transformed in ways that 
make it unrecognizable as the 
information you started with, 
but not ever lost. If this law is 
wrong, then the universe is in 
effect thumbing its nose at 
Laplace and all those who 
have been assuming that he 
was correct. 

Although Hawking ' s 
colleagues in Erhard's attic, 
in Susskind's words, stood 
there in 'stunned confusion', 



most of them and other 
theoretical physicists would 
go right on believing that the 
present has evolved from the 
past and will go on evolving 
into the future, that cause and 
effect continue to operate, 
that it is meaningful to trace 
events into the past and into 
the future, that examining the 
debris from a collision in a 
particle accelerator can tell 
you what happened in the 



collision - as though 
Hawking had not hung a 
Sword of Damocles over all 
these assumptions. But 
Hawking stuck to his guns 
and the information paradox 
didn't go away. Information, 
he continued to insist, is truly 
lost when black holes 
evaporate, and this means we 
can predict even less than we 
thought on the basis of 
quantum theory. 



Was there a fly in the 
ointment of quantum 
mechanics? Would the 
foundations of this well- 
established, dependable field 
have to shift? Hawking 
thought they would. As Kip 
Thorne has commented, 
Hawking is stubborn about 
insisting on his views of how 
nature works, and he likes to 
challenge others to show he's 
wrong.- Hawking had laid 



down the gauntlet. Susskind 
recalls that in Erhard's attic 
'Stephen had a "Stephen" 
look on his face, a little smile 
that says, "You may not 
believe it but I'm right, no 
mistake about it." We were 
absolutely sure Stephen was 
wrong but we couldn't see 
why.'^ 



fnl Hawking 's ideas were not 
the only serious threat to 



determinism in the 1980s. An 
equally significant one came 
from chaos theory. Ilya 
Prigogine and Isobel Stengers 
presented this challenge in 
their 1985 book Order Out of 
Chaos, writing, 'When faced 
with these unstable systems 
Laplace's [omniscient being] 
is just as powerless as we.' 
(Ilya Prigogine and Isobel 
Stengers, Order Out of 
Chaos, London: Heinemann, 



1985.)

The odds against a 
universe that has 
produced life like ours 
are immense' 

FOR HAWKING, 1981 was a 

landmark year not only for 
his calling attention to the 



information paradox. He was 
turning his attention in a new 
way to the question of how 
the universe began and how it 
would end. 

At a conference at the 
Vatican in September, Pope 
John Paul II, addressing 
Hawking and other scientists, 
said that it was probably 
futile for humans to try to 
inquire into the moment of 
Creation: this knowledge 



'comes from the revelation of 
God.'— Given the state of 
knowledge and theory at the 
time, which, thanks largely to 
Hawking, had the universe 
beginning in a singularity, no 
one could gainsay the Pope's 
words. Most of Hawking 's 
colleagues probably would 
have reluctantly agreed with 
the first part of the Pope's 
statement, while doubting 
God was ever going to lay 



down his cards. Hawking 
himself had recently told 
author John Boslough: 'The 
odds against a universe like 
ours emerging out of 
something like the Big Bang 
are enormous. I think there 
are clearly religious 
implications whenever you 
start to discuss the origins of 
the universe.' 1 

What the Pope and those 
who briefed him on science 



had failed to take into 
consideration was Hawking 's 
propensity for undermining 
his own previous discoveries. 
Hawking 's title for his 
presentation at this Vatican 
conference, The Boundary 
Conditions of the Universe', 
gave no forewarning that he 
would propose the possibility 
that there was no 'beginning' 
- 'no boundary' to the 
universe leaving no 



necessary role or place for a 
creator. Had the Pope and his 
science advisors known, they 
might have been sufficiently 
wise and well informed to 
decide that the Pope should 
draw a parallel between 
Hawking 's ideas and the 
Judeo-Christian concept 
(from the Jewish philosopher 
Philo of Alexandria and the 
Christian philosopher St 
Augustine) of a God existing 



outside time - the ' I Am' of 
the Bible - for whom 
beginnings, endings or 
anything like our 

chronological time do not 
exist. That way of looking at 
time was to be a major part of 
Hawking ' s ' no-boundary 
proposal'. It was not new to 
philosophy or religion, but it 
was to physics. 

The work Hawking had 
done in the late 1960s, in his 



Ph.D. dissertation and 
afterwards, seemed to prove 
that the universe had begun as 
a singularity, a point of 
infinite density and infinite 
spacetime curvature. At that 
singularity all our laws of 
physics would break down, 
and it would be just as useless 
as the Pope thought to try to 
investigate the moment of 
creation. Any sort of universe 
could come out of a 



singularity. There would 
certainly be no way to predict 
that it would be a universe 
like ours. It was in this 
context that Hawking had 
said that discussing the 
origins of the universe 
inevitably had religious 
implications.- 



The 'Anthropic 
Principle' 



Most of us have become 
convinced that the sun, the 
planets and everything else 
don't revolve around the 
Earth. Science also tells us 
that the universe probably 
looks the same from any 
vantage point. Earth, with us 
as its favoured passengers, 
isn't the centre of everything. 

Nevertheless, the more 
we discover on both the 
microscopic and the cosmic 



levels, the more we're struck 
with the impression that some 
careful planning, some 
incredible fine-tuning, had to 
occur to make the universe a 
place where it's possible for 
us to exist. In the early 1980s 
Hawking was saying, 'If one 
considers the possible 
constants and laws that could 
have emerged, the odds 
against a universe that has 
produced life like ours are 



immense. '- 

There are many examples 
of this mysterious fine- 
tuning: Hawking points out 
that if the electric charge of 
the electron had been slightly 
different, stars either 
wouldn't burn to give us light 
or wouldn't have exploded in 
supernovae to fling back into 
space the raw material for 
new stars like our sun or 
planets like Earth. If gravity 



were less powerful than it is, 
matter couldn't have 
congealed into stars and 
galaxies, nor could galaxies 
and solar systems have 
formed had gravity not been 
at the same time the weakest 
of the four forces. No theory 
we have at present can predict 
the strength of gravity or the 
electric charge of the 
electron. These are arbitrary 
elements, discoverable only 



by observation, but they seem 
minutely adjusted to make 
possible the development of 
life as we know it. 

Shall we jump to the 
conclusion that Someone or 
Something had us in mind 
when things were set up? Is 
the universe, as astronomer 
Fred Hoyle phrased it, ' a put 
up job', a great conspiracy to 
make intelligent life possible? 
Or are we missing other 



possible explanations? 

'We see the universe the 
way it is because we exist.' 
'Things are as they are 
because we are.' 'If it had 
been different we wouldn't be 
here to notice it. ' All of these 
are ways of stating something 
called the 'anthropic 
principle'. 

Hawking explains the 
anthropic principle as 
follows: picture a lot of 



different, separate universes, 
or different regions of the 
same universe. The 
conditions in most of these 
universes, or in these regions 
of the same universe, will not 
allow the development of 
intelligent life. However, in a 
very few of them, the 
conditions will be just right 
for stars and galaxies and 
solar systems to form and for 
intelligent beings to develop 



and study the universe and 
ask the question, why is the 
universe as we observe it? 
According to the anthropic 
principle, the only answer to 
their question may be that, if 
it were otherwise, we 
wouldn't be around to ask the 
question. 

Does the anthropic 
principle really explain 
anything? Some scientists say 
that it doesn't, that all it 



shows is how what seems like 
fine-tuning might instead be a 
random bit of good luck. It's 
like the old story about giving 
enough monkeys typewriters 
so that by the laws of chance 
one of them would type the 
first five lines of 
Shakespeare's Hamlet. Even 
if our sort of universe is 
highly unlikely, with enough 
universes around, one of them 
might very well be like ours. 



Does the anthropic 
principle rule out God? No. 
However, it does show that 
the universe could appear 
tailor-made for our good 
without there being a God. 

John Wheeler thought we 
might carry the anthropic 
principle a step further. 
Perhaps, he suggested, there 
can be no physical laws at all 
unless there are observers to 
work them out. In that case 



there won't be all those 
alternate universes, because 
any universe that didn't allow 
for the development of 
observers simply wouldn't 
exist. 

If this is so, does it mean 
that if we become extinct, so 
will the universe? Will the 
stage crew come out and 
dismantle the set as the last 
member of the audience 
leaves the theatre? In fact, if 



we're not around to 
remember that it existed, will 
it ever have existed? Does our 
having observed a brief slice 
of its existence give it the 
power to go on existing after 
we're gone? 

A few physicists like to 
make a connection between 
an 'observer-dependent' 
universe and some of the 
ideas in Eastern mysticism: 
Hinduism, Buddhism and 



Taoism. They get no 
encouragement from 
Hawking, who says, 'The 
universe of Eastern mysticism 
is an illusion. A physicist 
who attempts to link it with 
his own work has abandoned 
physics.'- 

Although he didn't invent 
the idea, the anthropic 
principle is often associated 
with Hawking, along with 
other colleagues and 



particularly Brandon Carter, 
Hawking 's office-mate in the 
mid-1960s, who also worked 
with him trying to refute the 
ideas of Jacob Bekenstein 
about black holes and entropy 
in 1972. Hawking and most 
other physicists hoped that 
we wouldn't have to turn to 
the anthropic principle as the 
only explanation for why we 
have the sort of universe we 
have and not another. 'Was it 



all just a lucky chance?' 
Hawking asks. 'That would 
seem a counsel of despair, a 
negation of all our hopes of 
understanding the underlying 
order of the universe.'- Those 
words would turn out to be 
prophetic. 

Meanwhile, the Pope had 
said it couldn't be done. The 
anthropic principle said it was 
just a roll of the dice (one roll 
among an almost infinite 



number) that fell in our 
favour. Some were arguing 
that God had the power to 
change His mind and adjust 
things, including the laws of 
the universe, whenever He 
pleased. But Hawking didn't 
think an all-powerful God 
would have any need to 
change his mind. He believed 
there are laws that held at the 
time that we call the 
beginning, or the Creation - 



that made our universe the 
way it is and not some other 
way - and that we are capable 
of understanding them. He 
wanted to know what those 
laws are. That meant that 
somehow he had to cut the 
ultimate Gordian knot: the 
singularity. 

It would be a couple of 
years before Hawking would 
fully work out how to 
perform that heroic feat. 



Meanwhile, in October 1981, 
not long after the visit to the 
Vatican, he was also busy 
looking at the beginning of 
the universe through the eyes 
of a new theory, known as 
'inflation theory'. 

Big Bang Challenge 

Back in the 1960s, everything 
had seemed to be falling into 
place for those who favoured 
the Big Bang theory. In 



1964-5 there was a 
particularly exciting step 
forward in the quest to 
understand the history of the 
universe and decide between 
the two competing models, 
the Big Bang and the Steady 
State. The story has become a 
classic. It was one of those 
relatively rare occasions in 
science when data turns up 
where no one is looking for it. 
At Bell Laboratories, in New 



Jersey, there was a horn 
antenna designed for use with 
the Echo I and Telstar 
communications satellites. 
The amount of background 
noise picked up by the 
antenna hampered the study 
of signals from space. 
Scientists working with the 
antenna had to make 
adjustments and resign 
themselves to studying 
signals that were stronger 



than the noise. It was an 
annoyance that most found it 
possible to ignore, but two 
young scientists, Arno 
Penzias and Robert Wilson, 
took the noise more seriously. 

Penzias and Wilson 
noticed that the level 
remained the same no matter 
in which direction they 
pointed the antenna. That 
wouldn't be the case if the 
noise were a result of Earth's 



atmosphere, since an antenna 
pointed towards the horizon 
faces more of the atmosphere 
than one pointed straight up. 
The noise had to be coming 
either from beyond the 
atmosphere or from the 
antenna itself. Penzias and 
Wilson thought pigeons 
nesting in the antenna might 
be the source, but evicting the 
pigeons and clearing away 
their droppings brought no 



improvement. 

Another radio astronomer, 
Bernard Burke, heard about 
Penzias's and Wilson's 
puzzle with the antenna, and 
he knew, as they did not, of 
current work by Robert Dicke 
at Princeton. Dicke, following 
up on a proposal made in the 
1940s by the Russian-born 
George Gamow and 
Americans Ralph Alpher and 
Robert Herman, was building 



an antenna to search for 
radiation surviving from not 
long after the origin of the 
universe, from an era when, if 
the Big Bang theory was 
correct, the universe would 
still have been very hot. 
Gamow, Alpher and Herman 
had theorized that such 
radiation should exist, and 
that by our own era its 
temperature should have 
cooled to about five degrees 



above absolute zero. Burke 
brought Penzias, Wilson and 
Dicke together, and they 
concluded that Penzias and 
Wilson had discovered by 
accident the radiation that 
Dicke had been hoping to 
find. 

The discovery of what 
soon became known as the 
'cosmic microwave 
background radiation', or 
CMBR, was dramatic support 



for the Big Bang theory, for 
clearly the universe had once 
been very much hotter and 
denser than it is now. 
Hawking and his friend 
George Ellis wrote a paper in 
1968 emphasizing how 
strongly this evidence 
supported the Big Bang.- 
However, it also posed a 
problem for that theory. In 
repeated measurements, taken 
out as far as possible in every 



direction, researchers found 
that the temperature of the 
radiation was the same and 
failed to find small variations 
in the CMBR that could have 
resulted in the structure we 
see today. 

Those problems aside, 
support for the Big Bang kept 
coming. There was a 
discovery that quasars, which 
theorists were realizing might 
be an early stage of galaxy 



formation, exist only at 
enormous distances from 
Earth. If the Steady State 
theory is correct, with 
galaxies continually 
spreading further and further 
apart and the emptiness 
between being filled by the 
formation of new galaxies, 
and if quasars are part of the 
process of galaxy formation, 
we ought to find quasars 
fairly evenly distributed near 



and far throughout the 
universe. They are not. 
Quasars' vast distance from 
Earth in space (and, by virtue 
of that fact, in time) means 
they must have existed only 
when the universe was much 
younger than it is now. This 
particular stage of galaxy 
formation must have occurred 
only in the distant past, has 
not occurred again in later 
epochs of the universe's 



history, and is not going on 
today. 

Yet another nail in the 
Steady State theory's coffin 
was hammered into place in 
1973 when balloon 
experiments at Berkeley 
found that the spectrum of the 
cosmic microwave 
background radiation was the 
spectrum that Big Bang 
theory predicted. And studies 
of the abundances of various 



elements in the Milky Way 
and other galaxies showed 
that Big Bang predictions of 
these abundances were on 
target. 

Nevertheless, in the 1970s 
the Big Bang theory still had 
stumbling blocks to 
overcome. While Hawking 
had diverted his attention to 
black holes, the question of 
how the universe began had 
also never been far from his 



mind; and how to solve the 
lingering problems of the Big 
Bang theory had remained 
high on the agenda for many 
of his colleagues around the 
world. These problems 
became known as the 
'horizon problem', the 
'flatness problem' and the 
' smoothness problem' . 

The horizon problem had 
to do with the observation 
that the cosmic microwave 



background radiation is the 
same in all directions in areas 
of the universe too far apart 
for radiation ever to have 
passed from one to the other, 
even in the earliest split 
seconds after the Big Bang. 
The intensity of radiation is 
so remarkably close to 
identical in those remote 
areas that it seems they must 
somehow have exchanged 
energy and come to 



equilibrium. How? 

The flatness problem had 
to do with the question of 
why the universe has not 
either long ago collapsed 
again to a Big Crunch or else 
experienced such runaway 
expansion that gravity 
wouldn't have been able to 
pull any matter together to 
form stars. A universe 
somehow poised, as ours 
seems to be, between those 



possibilities is so unlikely as 
to boggle the imagination. 
The expansive energy 
(resulting from the Big Bang) 
and the force of gravity 
would have had to be so close 
to equal that they differed 
from equality by no more 
than 1 in 10 60 (1 followed by 
sixty zeros) at a time less than 
10" 43 seconds after the Big 
Bang (a fraction with 1 as the 
numerator and 1 with 43 



zeros as the denominator). 

The smoothness problem 
was that, judging by the 
CMBR, the early universe 
must have been smooth, 
without any lumps, clumps, 
ridges or other irregularities. 
The question became one of 
the foremost challenges of 
astrophysics - a 'missing 
link' in Big Bang thinking: 
how did a universe that 
looked so uniform in the era 



from which the CMBR comes 
to us, when the universe was 
300,000 years old, become so 
diverse and clumpy all these 
years later - with stars, 
galaxies, galaxy clusters, 
planets - even such small 
clumps of matter as you and 
I? Why was it not possible to 
see even faint beginnings of 
that differentiation in the 
cosmic microwave 
background radiation? 



If that last seems an 
unlikely problem, think about 
Wheeler's democracy: the 
closer to one another the 
particles are, the stronger they 
feel each other's gravitational 
pull. If all particles of matter 
in the universe are equidistant 
and there are no areas in 
which a few particles have 
drawn together even slightly 
more densely, then every 
particle will feel equal pull 



from every direction and 
none will budge to move 
closer to any other particle. It 
was this sort of gridlock 
researchers seemed to have 
discovered in the early 
universe where matter 
appeared to have been 
distributed so evenly that it 
could never yield and form 
the structure evident in the 
universe today. 

In the mid-1970s, when 



Hawking first visited Caltech, 
no theorist had been 
successful in overcoming any 
of these stumbling blocks. 

Inflation to the 
Rescue! 

In the late 1970s a young 
particle physicist at the 
Stanford Linear Accelerator 
in California, Alan Guth, 
came up with a significant 



revision to the history of the 
universe as it had been 
written by cosmologists up to 
that time. Recognizing right 
away that he had hit on a 
good thing, Guth wrote 
'SPECTACULAR 
REALIZATION' in his 
notebook and drew two 
concentric boxes around the 
words. His realization offered 
a brilliant solution to still 
stubborn problems in Big 



Bang theory, and also 
suggested a way in which the 
universe could have got to be 
like the present universe 
without requiring that its 
initial state be chosen with 
such exquisitely precise care. 

Guth proposed that the 
universe might early on have 
undergone a brief interval of 
stupendously rapid growth, 
before settling down to 
continue expanding at the rate 



we find in our own era. It was 
the 'settling down' that 
particularly set his idea apart. 
Others had found solutions to 
Einstein's equations that 
produced a universe in which 
the expansion would 
accelerate during the whole 
of its existence, or where the 
expansion began by 
decelerating and then started 
to accelerate and never 
stopped. Guth's universe had 



only a short surge of 
accelerated expansion in its 
extreme infancy. 

Guth worked out a 
process in which the universe, 
at a time less than 10" 30 
seconds after the Big Bang (a 
fraction with 1 as the 
numerator and 1 followed by 
thirty zeros as the 
denominator), was subject to 
a huge repulsive force that for 
only a short interval behaved 



like the cosmological 
constant that Einstein 
rejected. During a period that 
lasted only an unimaginably 
small fraction of a second, 
this force would have 
accelerated the expansion, 
causing violent runaway 
inflation in the dimensions of 
the universe from a size 
smaller than a proton in the 
nucleus of an atom to about 
the size of a golf-ball. 



In the more than thirty 
years since Guth first 
suggested it, physicists have 
been embroidering on his 
idea, coming up with new 
versions, and trying to work 
out why and how this process 
might have happened. In 
order to understand this work, 
you must get your head 
around some terminology. 

Begin with symmetry- 
breaking: a simple example is 



a rod set on end. It could fall 
in any direction. Gravity, 
which makes it fall, is 
'symmetrical'; it has no 
preference which direction 
the rod falls. All directions 
are equally likely. But when 
the rod falls it will fall one 
way or another, not every 
way at once. When the rod 
falls, the symmetry is broken. 
Hawking used another 
example in A Brief History of 



Time: picture a roulette 
wheel. The croupier spins the 
wheel and the ball rolls round 
and round. The situation is 
'symmetrical'. Although you, 
who have placed a bet, may 
have a preferred outcome for 
this spin, the physics of the 
situation has no preferred 
outcome. The wheel slows 
and the speed (the high 
energy) of the ball decreases. 
Finally it falls into one of the 



slots in the wheel. The 
symmetry is broken. 2 

To demonstrate the 
meaning of 'false vacuum' 
and 'true vacuum', both of 
which are relevant in 
understanding inflation, 
physicists often like to picture 
a man's hat, the kind with a 
brim around the edge and a 
depression in the crown. Put a 
marble into the depression in 
the crown of the hat. It will 



settle down at the lowest spot 
available. This is not the 
lowest it could get on the hat, 
but it's the lowest on the 
crown of the hat. Likewise, 
elementary particles can 
'land' in a number of 
temporary energy levels. 
These resting places are 'false 
vacuums'. Jostle the hat or let 
the marbles bump around 
against one another and the 
marbles may roll from the 



crown of the hat to the brim. 
In this analogy the brim 
represents the 'true vacuum'. 
We can recognize it as the 
lowest possible energy level 
in this system. 

Something like that could 
have happened as the 
universe cooled down. Some 
of the matter started moving 
towards a new state with 
lower energy, in the process 
liberating the gravitationally 



repulsive stress that caused 
the rapid acceleration that 
was inflation. But, to return to 
the analogy, the marbles 
probably didn't all roll down 
at once. How they rolled, how 
fast they rolled, how they 
made it over the edge of the 
crown, or through the edge of 
the crown - or whether 
inflation happened in an 
entirely different way - these 
questions have been 



occupying cosmologists for 
decades. Nearly all, however, 
agree that inflation occurred. 
Inflation has become part of 
the 'standard model'. 

Another useful bit of 
vocabulary is 'phase 
transition'. An everyday 
example of a 'phase 
transition' is the freezing of 
water (which also involves a 
breaking of symmetry). 
Water as a liquid is 



symmetrical, the same 
everywhere and in every 
direction. Lower the 
temperature sufficiently and 
ice crystals form. No longer 
is everything the same 
everywhere. The crystals 
have certain positions and not 
others, and they line up in 
some direction and not 
another. The symmetry is 
broken. However, if you 
reduce the temperature of 



water very carefully, it can go 
below freezing without ice 
forming, without the 
symmetry being broken. The 
name for this is 
'supercooling'. It happens in 
nature when liquid drops of 
rain fall during a winter storm 
and remain liquid even 
though the air temperature is 
below freezing, until they 
encounter something - a tree, 
a pavement and 



immediately freeze. 

Alan Guth's suggestion 
rested on the idea that the 
universe immediately after 
the Big Bang would have 
been extremely hot, with all 
the particles moving around 
very rapidly, at high energies. 
The four forces of nature 
discussed in Chapter 2 - 
gravity, electromagnetism, 
the strong nuclear force and 
the weak nuclear force - were 



still united at that time, 
undifferentiated, as one 
superforce. The universe 
expanded slightly, cooled 
slightly. The particle energies 
became slightly less, and, as 
the universe cooled, the 
forces became separate and 
distinct from one another. 
Their initial symmetry was 
broken. One by one they 
'froze out'. It didn't all 
happen at once, however, 



because supercooling 
occurred. There was a phase 
transition, with bits of the 
universe going through this 
transition separately in the 
form of bubbles where the 
temperature dropped below 
some value (analogous to 
water going below the 
freezing point) without the 
symmetry between the forces 
being broken. The result was 
that the universe entered an 



unstable, supercooled state, 
with more energy than it 
would have had if the 
symmetry among the forces 
had been broken. 

Bubbles, marbles, hats, 
frozen water ... the bottom 
line of early inflation theory 
was, Hawking explains, that 
during this interval all regions 
of the universe - including 
those with more particles than 
average, and those with less - 



expanded at an enormous 
rate, faster than the speed of 
light. Even where there were 
more matter particles than 
average and you might expect 
gravity to be drawing them 
together, that could not have 
happened. As matter particles 
got farther apart, the result 
would have been a universe, 
still expanding, with all its 
particles few and far between. 
The expansion would have 



smoothed out irregularities, 
meaning that the universe's 
modern-day smooth and 
uniform state could have 
evolved from a great variety 
of different initial states. The 
rate of expansion would 
automatically have become 
close to the critical rate, 
solving the 'flatness problem' 
without the initial rate having 
been so carefully chosen.- 
How, then, did the 



expansion slow down again? 
Like the rain drops that resist 
turning to ice but must 
eventually freeze, the 
universe had to complete its 
temporarily arrested phase 
transition. Guth's original 
proposal had it that when 
supercooling occurred, in this 
overall milieu of t/^broken 
symmetry, bubbles of broken 
symmetry formed, and these 
bubbles expanded and joined 



with one another until 
everything everywhere was in 
a new phase of broken 
symmetry, and the universe 
was expanding more or less 
as we discover it doing today. 

Initially, there was a 
problem with this idea. The 
bubbles would have expanded 
so quickly that they would 
have collided with one 
another, resulting in many 
irregularities and enormous 



variations in density and in 
the expansion rate from one 
part of the universe to 
another. This situation could 
never have developed into 
our universe. 

Nevertheless, Guth went 
ahead and announced his 
theory. It promised too much 
to be allowed to flounder on a 
glitch he was certain he or 
others would be able to solve 
later. It offered solutions to 



the remaining problems in 
Big Bang theory: our visible 
universe could have emerged 
from a region originally so 
tiny that it had the 
opportunity to reach 
equilibrium before it inflated. 
The period of runaway 
inflation could have wiped 
out the imbalance between 
the expansive energy and the 
contracting force of gravity. 
The prediction that inflation 



would generate areas of 
slightly higher and slightly 
lower density - the seeds of 
future galaxies, supergalaxies 
and all the other structure that 
has evolved in the universe - 
was particularly promising. 
Technology for observing the 
cosmic microwave 
background radiation had not 
yet been able to reveal those 
'density perturbations', but 
Stephen Hawking and others 



had been thinking about them 
and the smoothness problem 
since the mid-sixties when 
Wilson and Penzias had 
discovered the CMBR. Could 
inflation provide the answer 
cosmologists had been 
looking for? 

Hawking, like Guth 
himself, was not satisfied. 
Hawking 's objection to 
inflation theory was not that 
the bubbles would collide and 



cause havoc instead of a 
smooth universe, but that in 
the inflationary phase the 
universe would have been 
expanding too rapidly for 
bubbles of broken symmetry 
ever to join with one another. 
He thought they would have 
scattered apart too quickly, 
even if they were growing at 
the speed of light. The result 
would have been a universe 
where the symmetry among 



the four forces was broken in 
some areas and not in others 
- again, definitely not our 
universe. With that in mind in 
October 1981, Hawking set 
off for a conference in 
Moscow. 

A Debate in Moscow 

The Russian physicist Andrei 
Linde, aged thirty-three, a 
graduate of Moscow 
University and the P. N. 



Lebedev Physics Institute in 
Moscow, was about to 
encounter Stephen Hawking 
for the first time under rather 
teeth-grinding circumstances 
at that Moscow conference. 

A few years before Alan 
Guth developed and 
published his model of 
inflation, Linde himself had 
been thinking along those 
same lines but recognized 
that this type of theory had 



problems. Not so reticent as 
Linde, Guth of course had 
recognized the same 
problems but daringly and, as 
it turned out, wisely gone 
ahead and published his paper 
anyway, beating Linde to the 
draw. That setback 
notwithstanding, it would not 
take long for Linde to catch 
up and move to the head of 
the roster of cosmologists 
working in the field of 



inflation theory. After 1990 
he would also be famous 
among colleagues at Stanford 
for his sleight-of-hand magic, 
acrobatics and hypnosis, but 
in 1981, when he met 
Hawking at the conference in 
Moscow, he was still 
relatively inexperienced, 
barely known in the West, 
and had never been to 
America or Europe. Stephen 
Hawking was a distinguished 



and honoured attendee. 

Linde and Hawking both 
presented papers. In his 
presentation Hawking spoke 
of his recent findings that 
inflation would have 
generated density 
perturbations that were too 
large to result in the universe 
as we find it today. Linde, in 
his presentation, explained a 
way he had worked out the 
previous summer to solve the 



problems in his and Guth's 
original inflation models. 
Because of the Soviet 
Union's long delays due to 
censorship before a paper 
could be released, Linde's 
'new inflation' paper would 
not be published until early in 
1982. Linde had no 
opportunity at the conference 
to discuss his ideas with 
Hawking, but after it ended, 
circumstances brought them 



together. At the celebration of 
Hawking 's sixtieth birthday 
in 2002, Linde vividly 
described both the trauma and 
the eventual success of that 
first meeting. - 

The Sternberg Astronomy 
Institute in Moscow had 
invited Hawking to give a 
lecture the day after the 
conference ended, and he had 
chosen as his subject 
problems in Alan Guth's 



inflation theory. At the last 
minute, Linde, who was 
fluent in English and Russian, 
was asked to translate. This 
was during the time when it 
was customary for Hawking 
to have one of his students 
deliver his talks while he 
listened and occasionally 
intervened to make a 
comment or correction. For 
some reason this talk had not 
been prepared in that way. 



Linde recalled the tedious 
two-stage translation process. 
Hawking said something in 
his garbled voice; Hawking 's 
student struggled to 
understand and then repeated 
it clearly in English; Linde 
translated it into Russian. It 
all moved at a glacial pace. 
However, Linde knew the 
subject well and began 
adding explanations in 
Russian. Hawking would 



make a statement; the student 
would repeat it; Linde would 
expound, saving Hawking the 
trouble of explaining what he 
had said. Hawking seemed 
not to object and all went 
much more smoothly and 
rapidly, as long as they were 
talking about the old inflation 
theory. 

There came a moment, 
however, when Linde was 
startled to hear the student 



say, for Hawking, that Andrei 
Linde had recently 'suggested 
an interesting way to solve 
the problems of inflationary 
theory'.- Linde was delighted 
to translate that 

announcement into Russian. 
Top Russian physicists were 
about to hear Stephen 
Hawking explain his 
(Linde' s) theory! His future 
in theoretical physics seemed 
exceedingly bright, but only 



for a few seconds. Hawking 
proceeded to tear apart 
Linde's new inflation 
scenario. For a painful and 
embarrassing half-hour Linde 
'was translating for Stephen 
and explaining to everyone 
the problems with my 
scenario and why it did not 
work'. 11 At the end of the 
talk, Linde summoned 
extraordinary courage and 
told the audience that he had 



translated but did not agree 
with Hawking, and he 
explained why. Then he 
suggested that he and 
Hawking continue the 
discussion in private. 
Hawking might have 
interpreted that to mean 'Step 
outside and say that! ' But no, 
they found an empty office, 
and while the Institute 
officials searched in a panic 
for the 'famous British 



scientist who had 
miraculously disappeared', - 
Hawking and Linde talked for 
two hours and then moved to 
Hawking 's hotel to continue 
their debate. By then things 
were looking up for Linde. 
'He started showing me 
photos of his family and 
invited me to Cambridge. 
This was the beginning of a 
beautiful friendship. '- 

Hawking had not been 



wrong to be dissatisfied with 
Linde's 'new inflation'. 
Linde had suggested a 
solution to the problem of the 
bubbles of broken symmetry 
not being able to join with 
one another: suppose the 
bubbles were large enough so 
that what would later evolve 
into our region of the 
universe could be all inside 
one bubble. In order for this 
to be possible, the change 



from symmetry to broken 
symmetry would have had to 
happen much more slowly 
inside the bubble. Hawking 
objected that Linde's 'new 
inflation' bubbles would have 
had to be too large - larger 
than the entire universe was 
at the time all this was 
happening. The theory also 
still predicted much larger 
variations in the temperature 
of the microwave background 



radiation than had been 
observed. 

Not long after the 
Moscow conference Hawking 
made a trip to Philadelphia. 
In an address there, as 
recipient of the Benjamin 
Franklin Medal in Physics 
from the Franklin Institute, he 
departed from a strictly 
scientific topic to talk about 
something that had been of 
serious concern to both 



himself and Jane since the 
early years of their marriage - 
the dangerous threat that the 
USSR's and the United 
States' escalating nuclear 
stockpiles were posing to life 
on Earth. Back in 1962, 
Diana King had mentioned in 
Jane Wilde's hearing: 'He 
goes on Ban the Bomb 
marches.' Hawking was still 
marching. 

Soon after his return to 



Cambridge, however, 
Hawking was back in the 
inflation discussion. He 
received in his post a letter 
from Physics Letters asking 
him to review Linde's 
inflation paper for 
publication.- Hawking 
recommended that they 
publish the paper,- in spite of 
the fact that both he and 
Linde recognized that there 
were flaws. The paper was 



significant and deserved to be 
widely read, and if Linde 
were to make the necessary 
revisions, they would be 
delayed too long passing 
through Soviet censorship. At 
the same time Hawking and a 
graduate student, Ian Moss, 
submitted a paper of their 
own suggesting what they 
thought was a more 
satisfactory way to end the 
inflationary period: if the 



symmetry had broken (still 
slowly as Linde had 
proposed) not just inside 
bubbles but everywhere at the 
same time, the result would 
be the uniform universe that 
we live in.— With all these 
ideas in the air, Hawking and 
his DAMTP colleague Gary 
Gibbons decided to organize 
a workshop, focusing mainly 
on inflation, to take place the 
following summer. 



Hawking' s super-capable 
secretary, Judy Fella, got to 
work. 

In January 1982 Hawking 
turned forty, a birthday he 
had not expected to reach. 
There was more to celebrate. 
Hawking was on the New 
Year's Honours list, made a 
Commander of the British 
Empire. At the investiture 
ceremony at Buckingham 
Palace on 23 February, 



Robert was his father's 
assistant. Now Hawking 
could put CBE after his 
name. 

Making Inflation 
Work 

From 21 June to 9 July 1982, 
the wizards of inflation 
finally put their heads 
together in Cambridge at the 
Nuffield Workshop on the 



Very Early Universe. Andrei 
Linde came over from Russia. 
Alan Guth was there, and so 
was Paul Steinhardt, a 
physicist at the University of 
Pennsylvania, who with his 
colleague Andreas Albrecht 
had come up with a 'new 
inflation' theory 
independently of Linde and 
very similar to his, at about 
the same time.— Hawking 's 
contribution to the meeting 



was to show how the 
temperature of the universe 
during the inflationary period 
could inevitably lead to small 
density perturbations .— 

Later in the summer 
Hawking flew to California 
again, this time to Santa 
Barbara, to spend some 
weeks at the University of 
California's new Institute of 
Theoretical Physics. This was 
Jim Hartle's home territory, 



and while Hawking was there 
the two of them discussed the 
idea that he had introduced at 
the Vatican in September 
1981. 

The 'no-boundary proposal' 
had taken something of a 
back seat during all the 
discussion of inflation theory, 
but Hawking had not stopped 
thinking seriously about it. 
Over the next two years, he 
and Hartle worked out that 



proposal. 

fnl Hawking 's comment in A 
Brief History of Time that the 
Pope had said scientists 
'should not inquire into the 
moment of Creation' was 
either a misquotation or a 
mistranslation of the Pope's 
words. 

fn2 Linde, Steinhardt and 
Albrecht now are given joint 
credit for the 'new inflation 



model'.

'In all my travels, I 
have not managed to 
fall off the edge of the 
world' 

HAWKING' S SUGGESTION THAT 

black holes emit radiation had 
been greeted at first with 



scepticism in 1974, but we've 
seen that most physicists soon 
came to agree it wasn't 
nonsense after all. Black 
holes must radiate as any hot 
body does if our other ideas 
about general relativity and 
quantum mechanics aren't 
badly out. No one has found a 
primordial black hole, but if 
one were discovered, 
physicists would be shocked 
to find it not emitting a 



shower of gamma rays and X- 
rays. 

Go back to thinking about 
the particles that are emitted 
by a black hole in Hawking 
radiation. A pair of particles 
appears at the event horizon. 
The particle with negative 
energy falls into the black 
hole. The fact that its energy 
is negative means we have 
energy subtracted from the 
black hole. What happens to 



that energy? (Recall that we 
don't think energy can simply 
disappear from the universe.) 
It is carried off into space 
with the positive energy 
particle ( see Chapter 6 ). 

The upshot, you'll 
remember, is that the black 
hole loses mass and its event 
horizon shrinks. For a 
primordial black hole the 
whole story may end with the 
black hole's disappearing 



completely, probably with an 
impressive fireworks display. 
How can something escape 
from a black hole if nothing 
can escape from a black hole? 
It really was one of the great 
'locked room mysteries' of 
all time, solved by 'S. H.' 

The idea that matter in a 
black hole didn't necessarily 
reach the absolute end of time 
at a singularity had triggered 
suspicions about another 



singularity: the singularity 
Hawking had decided earlier 
was at the absolute beginning 
of time. Quantum theory 
offered a fresh possibility: 
maybe the Big Bang 
singularity is, as Hawking 
terms it, 'smeared away'. 
Maybe the door isn't 
slammed in our faces after 
all. 

Hawking points to a 
similar problem which 



quantum theory solved early 
in our century, a problem 
related to Rutherford's model 
of the atom: 'There was a 
problem with the structure of 
the atom, which was 
supposed to consist of a 
number of electrons orbiting 
around the central nucleus, 
like the planets around the 
Sun' (look back at Figure 
2.1 ). 'The previous classical 
theory predicted that each 



electron would radiate light 
waves because of its motion. 
The waves would carry away 
energy and so would cause 
the electrons to spiral inwards 
until they collided with the 
nucleus.' 1 Something had to 
be wrong with this picture, 
because atoms don 't collapse 
in this manner. 

Quantum mechanics, with 
the uncertainty principle, 
came to the rescue. We can't 



know simultaneously both a 
definite position and a 
definite momentum for an 
electron. 'If an electron were 
to sit on the nucleus, it would 
have both a definite position 
and a definite velocity,' 
Hawking points out. 'Instead, 
quantum mechanics predicts 
that the electron does not 
have a definite position but 
that the probability of finding 
it is spread out over some 



region around the nucleus.' 
The electrons don't spiral 
inwards and hit the nucleus. 
Atoms don't collapse. 

According to Hawking, 
'The prediction of classical 
theory [that we will find the 
electrons at the nucleus] is 
rather similar to the 
prediction of classical general 
relativity that there should be 
a Big Bang singularity of 
infinite density. '- Knowing 



that everything is at one point 
of infinite density at the Big 
Bang or in a black hole is too 
precise a measurement to be 
allowed by the uncertainty 
principle. To Hawking' s way 
of thinking this principle 
should 'smear out' the 
singularities predicted by 
general relativity, just as it 
smeared out the positions of 
electrons. There is no 
collapse of the atom, and he 



suspected that there was no 
singularity at the beginning of 
the universe or inside a black 
hole. Space would be very 
compressed there, but 
probably not to a point of 
infinite density. 

The theory of general 
relativity had predicted that 
inside a black hole and at the 
Big Bang the curvature of 
spacetime becomes infinite. If 
that doesn't happen, then 



Hawking wanted to work out 
'what shape space and time 
may adopt instead of the 
point of infinite curvature '.- 

When Time is Time 
and Space is Space 

If you find the following 
discussion difficult, don't 
hesitate to skim over it. It 
isn't necessary to understand 
every word to appreciate 



Hawking' s theory, but it's 
more interesting if you can. 
Of course, the maths 
Hawking uses to describe it, 
and that you and I would 
need in order to understand 
him completely, is much 
more complicated than the 
simple maths you will find 
here. 

Relativity theory links 
space and time in four- 
dimensional spacetime: three 



dimensions of space and one 
of time. Take a look at what a 
spacetime diagram is like. 
Overleaf is one that I once 
drew showing my daughter 
Caitlin on her way from her 
classroom at school to the 
room where the children ate 
their lunch. The vertical line 
on the left represents the 
passage of time. The 
horizontal line at the bottom 
represents all the space 



dimensions. Any single point 
on our spacetime diagram 
represents a position in space 
and a moment in time. Let's 
see how this works. 

The diagram ( Figure 
10.1 ) begins with Caitlin at 
her desk in her classroom, at 
12.00 noon. She sits still, 
moving forward in time but 
going nowhere in space. On 
the diagram a little band of 
'Caitlin' moves forward in 



time. At 12.05 the bell rings. 
Caitlin moves towards the 
lunch room. (Her desk still 
moves forward in time but 
goes nowhere in space.) 
Caitlin moves in both time 
and space. At 12.07 she 
pauses to retie her trainer. For 
one minute she moves 
forward in time but does not 
move in space. At 12.08 she's 
off again towards the lunch 
room, walking a little faster 



than before so that the food 
won't all be gone by the time 
she gets there. At 12.15 she 
arrives at the lunch room. A 
physicist would say we have 
traced Caitlin's 'world-line'. 

That spacetime diagram 
was a very sketchy affair. 
When physicists draw a 
spacetime diagram, they often 
use a common unit for both 
space and time. They might, 
for instance, use one yard as 



the unit of both space and 
time. (One yard of time is 
very small, only billionths of 
a second. It's the time it takes 
a photon, which moves at the 
speed of light, to travel one 
yard.) In such a spacetime 
diagram, if something moves 
four yards in space and four 
yards in time, its world-line 
traces a 45-degree angle. 
That's the world-line for 
something moving at the 



speed of light, a photon, for 
instance ( Figure 10.2 ). 




Distance in Space 



Figure 10.1. Caitlin in Spacetime 



If something moves three 
yards in space and four in 
time, it's moving at three- 
fourths the speed of light 
( Figure 10.3a ). If something 
moves four yards in space 
and three in time, it's 
exceeding the speed of light, 
which isn't allowed ( Figure 
10.3b ).

using one yard as the unit of both

travels four yards in space and 
four yards in time, its 'world-line' 
traces a 45-degree angle on a 
spacetime diagram. That 's the 
world-line for a photon, or 
anything else moving at the speed 
of light. 

The next diagram ( Figure 
10.4 ) shows two events 
happening simultaneously. 
They have no way of 
knowing about each other at 



the instant they happen 
because, for them to do so, 
the in formation would have 
to have a world- line running 
at a 90-degree angle from the 
time-line. Travelling such a 
world-line would require 
faster- than-light travel. 
Nothing can travel faster than 
light and light can't manage 
anything greater than a 45- 
degree angle on the diagram.

When the distance travelled is 
greater in space than in time, as in 
this case, the object is exceeding 
the speed of light (not allowed!).

showing two events (X and Y) that 

occur simultaneously but at a 
distance from each other in space. 
They can 't know about each other 
at the exact moment they occur, 

because that would require 
information from one to the other 
to travel a world-line running at 
greater than a 45-degree angle 
from the time-line. A world-line 

running at greater than a 45- 
degree angle requires faster-than- 
light travel. That's not allowed in 
our universe. 



Now we'll talk about the 



'length' of a world-line. How 
shall we say what the length 
of a world-line is - a 'length' 
that takes into account all 
four dimensions? 

Let's examine the world- 
line of something that moves 
a lot faster than Caitlin. The 
object in Figure 10.5 moves 
four yards in space and five 
in time: four- fifths the speed 
of light. Think of the distance 
it moves in the 'space' 



direction on the diagram as 
one side of a triangle (side A). 
Think of the distance it 
moves in the 'time' direction 
on the diagram as a second 
side (side B). That makes two 
sides of a right-angled 
triangle. The world-line of the 
moving object is the 
hypotenuse of that triangle 
(side Q. 

Most of us have learned 
that the square of the 



hypotenuse of a right-angled 
triangle is equal to the sum of 
the squares of the other two 
sides. The square of 4 (side 

A) is 16. The square of 5 (side 

B) is 25. The sum of 16 and 
25 is 41. The length of side C, 
the hypotenuse, would be the 
square root of 41. 

Never mind trying to find 
that square root. That is 
another issue. It would be our 
next challenge if we were 



working with our familiar 
school geometry. However, 
for spacetime things work 
differently. The square of the 
hypotenuse (side Q is not 
equal to the sum of the 
squares of the other two 
sides. It's equal to the 
difference between the 
squares of the two other 
sides. Our object travels four 
yards in space (side A of the 
triangle) and five yards in 



time (side B). The square of 4 
is 16; the square of 5 is 25. 
The difference between 25 
and 16 is 9. The square root 
of 9 is 3. So we know that the 
third side of the triangle, side 
C, the world-line of our 
travelling object, is three 
yards in length in spacetime.

Let's say, just for the fun 
of it, that the object is 
someone wearing a watch. 
The watch will show that 
length (three yards) as 'time'. 
In Figure 10.6 (see p. 206) 



Lauren remains stationary in 
space and measures five 
hours on her watch. Her twin 
brother Tim, moving at four- 
fifths the speed of light, 
meanwhile measures only 
three hours on his. Tim turns 
around and returns, again 
measuring three hours while 
Lauren measures five. Tim is 
slightly younger than Lauren 
when next they meet. This is 
one of the remarkable, 



unbelievable things that 
Einstein taught us about the 
universe. 

Now let's consider 
spacetime diagrams and 
world-lines of some smaller 
objects, elementary particles. 

' Sums-Over- 
Histories', or: The 
Likelihood of Visiting 
Venus 



Remember the smeared- out 
positions of electrons in the 
model of the atom we talked 
about earlier. Their positions 
were 'smeared out' because 
we couldn't measure 
simultaneously both the 
position and the momentum 
of any one of them very 
precisely. Richard Feynman 
had a way of dealing with this 
problem which we now call 
' sums-over-histories ' . 



Imagine that you are 
considering all the different 
routes Red Riding Hood 
might take from home to her 
grandmother's cottage - not 
just the quickest way as the 
crow flies or the safest route 
avoiding as much as possible 
the wolf-infested woods, but 
every possible route she 
might take. There are billions 
and billions of possible 
routes. You ultimately get a 



gigantic fuzzy picture of her 
making the journey by all 
these routes at once. 
However, some are certainly 
more likely than others. If 
you study the probabilities of 
her taking the various routes, 
you conclude that she is very 
unlikely at any time between 
home and grandmother to be 
found on the planet Venus, 
for instance. But according to 
Feynman you must not 



completely rule out her 
passing through there. The 
probability for that route is 
extremely low, but not zero. 

In a similar manner, with 
sums-over-histories, 
physicists work out every 
possible path in spacetime 
that could have been travelled 
by a certain particle, all the 
possible 'histories' the 
particle could have had. It's 
possible then to calculate the 



probability of a particle's 
having passed through a 
particular point, something 
like calculating how likely 
Red Riding Hood is to travel 
by way of the planet Venus. 
(You don't want to get the 
idea, however, that particles 
choose a path. That would be 
carrying the analogy too far.)

twm sister when he 
returns to meet her. 



Figure 10.6. The 'twin paradox' 



Hawking decided to put 
sums-over-histories to 
another use, to study all the 
different histories the 
universe could have and 
which are more probable than 
others. 

As we continue, you'll 
need to know that even 
though the theory of relativity 



taught us to think of three 
dimensions of space and one 
of time as four dimensions of 
spacetime, there are still 
physical differences between 
space and time. One of these 
differences has to do with the 
way we measure the four- 
dimensional distance between 
two points in spacetime: the 
hypotenuse of the 
aforementioned triangle. 

Figure 10.7a (overleaf) 



shows two separate events (X 
and Y) on a spacetime 
diagram. They are connected 
by a world-line at more than a 
45 -degree angle from the 
time-line. No information can 
pass between these events 
without exceeding the speed 
of light. In a case like this, 
where the distance between 
two events is greater in space 
than it is in time, the square 
on the hypotenuse (side Q of 



our triangle is a positive 
number. In the language of 
physics the square of the 
'four-dimensional separation' 
between events X and Y is 
positive. 

Figure 10.7b also shows 
two events. The distance 
between them is greater in 
time than it is in space. A 
world-line between these 
events runs at a less than 45- 
degree angle from the time- 



line. Information travelling at 
less than the speed of light 
can reach Y from X. When 
this is true, the square on the 
hypotenuse (side C) of our 
triangle is a negative number. 
Physicists say the square of 
the four-dimensional 
separation between X and 7 is 
negative.

Perhaps you got lost in 
those last two paragraphs. If 
you didn't, a red light may 
have flashed on in your brain. 
The square of a number can't 
be negative. That doesn't 
happen in our mathematics. If 
the square of a number were a 
negative number, what 
number could possibly be its 
square root? What is the 



square root, for instance, of 
minus 9? In our mathematics 
the square of any number 
(negative or positive) is 
always positive: 3 squared 
(3 2 ) is 9; so is minus 3 
squared (~3 2 ). We can't 
possibly arrive at minus 9. 
It's impossible for the square 
of anything to be a negative 
number. 

Stephen Hawking and 
other mathematicians and 



physicists have a way around 
this problem: imagine that 
there are numbers that do 
produce negative numbers 
when multiplied by 
themselves, and see what 
happens. Say that imaginary 
one, when multiplied by 
itself, gives minus one. 
Imaginary two, multiplied by 
itself, gives minus four. 
Calculate the sums-over- 
histories of the particles and 



sums-over-histories of the 
universe using imaginary 
numbers. Calculate them in 
'imaginary' rather than 'real' 
time. The time it takes to get 
from point X to point Y in 
Figure 10.7b is imaginary 
time - the square root of 
minus nine - imaginary three. 

Imaginary numbers are a 
mathematical device (a trick, 
if you prefer) to help 
calculate answers that would 



otherwise be nonsense. 
'Imaginary time' allows 
physicists to study gravity on 
the quantum level in a better 
way, and it gives them a new 
way of looking at the early 
universe. 

Smearing Out the 
Speed of Light? 

Travelling back into the very 
early universe, as space 



becomes more and more 
compressed, there are fewer 
possible choices about where 
a particle is (its position) at a 
given moment. The position 
becomes a more and more 
precise measurement. 
Because of the uncertainty 
principle this causes the 
measurement of the particle's 
momentum to become less 
and less precise. 

First, let's look at the 



photon, the particle of light, 
under more normal 
circumstances. Photons move 
at 186,000 miles (300,000 
kilometres) per second, 
making the speed of light 
186,000 miles (300,000 
kilometres) per second. Now 
I have to tell you that this 
might not always be the case. 
(Having read this far, you are 
accustomed to such 
reversals!) We've seen that 



the probability of finding an 
electron is spread out over 
some region around the 
nucleus of an atom: more 
likely at some distances than 
others, but definitely a very 
smeary affair. Photons, like 
electrons, can't 
simultaneously be pinned 
down precisely as to both 
position and momentum, 
because of the uncertainty 
principle. 



Just so, Richard Feynman 
and others have told us that 
the probability that a photon 
is travelling at 186,000 miles 
(300,000 kilometres) per 
second may be spread out 
over some 'region' around 
that speed. That's the same as 
saying that, in one way of 
thinking about it, the speed of 
a photon fluctuates more or 
less around what we call light 
speed. Over long distances 



probabilities cancel out, so as 
to make the speed of a photon 
186,000 miles (300,000 
kilometres) per second. 
However, over very small 
distances, on the quantum 
level, there's a possibility that 
a photon may move at 
slightly less or slightly more 
than this speed. These 
fluctuations won't be seen 
directly, but the path of 
photons on the spacetime 



diagram, which we've drawn 
as a 45-degree angle, gets a 
little fuzzy. 

When we're studying the 
very early universe, when 
space is very compressed, 
that line gets very fuzzy. The 
uncertainty principle means 
that the more precisely we 
measure the position of a 
photon, the less precisely 
we're able to measure its 
momentum. When we say 



that in the very early universe 
everything was packed to 
near-infinite density (not a 
singularity, but nearly there), 
we're becoming 
extraordinarily precise about 
the location of particles such 
as photons. When we are that 
precise about position, our 
imprecision about momentum 
vastly increases. As we near 
infinite density we also get 
near an infinite number of 



possibilities of what the speed 
of a photon is. What happens 
to our spacetime diagram 
now? Look at Figure 10.8 . 
The world-line of a photon 
that in more normal 
circumstances is shown as a 
45 -degree angle becomes 
terribly smeared out. It 
fluctuates and ripples wildly. 

Here is another way of 
thinking about what causes 
this 'rippling', a way which 



will link it more clearly with 
other concepts in this book. 
Travelling back into the very 
early universe is like 
shrinking ourselves to a size 
so unimaginably tiny that we 
can see what's happening on 
the level of the extremely 
small. Imagine it like this: if 
you look at this page, it seems 
smooth. You can curl the 
paper a bit, but it's still 
smooth. In the same way, 



although there is some 
curvature, spacetime around 
us seems smooth. On the 
other hand, if you look at this 
page under a microscope, you 
see curves and bumps. 
Similarly, if you look at 
space-time on the extremely 
tiny level, billions on billions 
of times smaller than an 
atom, you find violent 
fluctuations in the geometry 
of spacetime ( Figure 10.9 ) 



( see here ). We'll discuss this 
again in Chapter 12 and learn 
that it might result in 
something called 
'wormholes'. For the time 
being, the point is that we 
would find the same violent 
fluctuations in the very early 
universe, where everything 
was compressed to just such 
extreme smallness.

Figure 10.8. The uncertainty 
principle in the early universe 



How can we explain this 
violent, chaotic scene? Again 
we turn to the uncertainty 
principle. We saw in Chapter 
6 that the uncertainty 
principle also means that a 
field, such as an 
electromagnetic field or a 
gravitational field, can't have 
a definite value and a definite 
rate of change over time. 
Zero would be a definite 
measurement, so a field can't 



measure zero. All fields 
would have to measure 
exactly zero in empty space. 
So, no zero, no empty space. 
What do we have instead of 
empty space? A continuous 
fluctuation in the value of all 
fields, a wobbling a bit 
towards the positive and 
negative sides of zero so as to 
average out to zero but not be 
zero. This fluctuation can be 
thought of as the pairs of 



particles in Hawking 
radiation. Particle pair 
production is greater where 
the curvature of spacetime is 
most severe and changing 
most quickly. That's why we 
expect to find so many of 
them at the event horizon of a 
black hole. 



Figure 10.9. The quantum vacuum, 
as imagined by John Wheeler in 
1957, becomes more and more 
chaotic as you inspect smaller 
regions of space. At the scale of the 
atomic nucleus (top), space still 
looks very smooth. Looking much 
more closely than that (middle), we 
see a roughness begin to appear. 
At a scale 1,000 times smaller still 
(bottom), the curvature undergoes 
violent fluctuations. 

In the very early universe 



we find a situation of 
extremely great spacetime 
curvature and rapid change in 
that curvature. The quantum 
fluctuations in all fields, 
including the gravitational 
field, become very violent. If 
there are violent fluctuations 
in a gravitational field, that is 
the same as saying there are 
violent fluctuations in the 
curvature of spacetime. We 
are not talking about big 



curves, such as swells on the 
ocean. We are talking about 
all sorts of continuously 
changing crinkles and ripples 
and swirls. Odd things 
happen to the world-line of a 
photon in such a wild and 
weird environment. Again see 
Figures 10.8 and 10.9 . 

Whichever of these 
explanations we prefer, the 
point is that the difference 
between the time direction 



and directions in space 
disappears. When time looks 
like space, we no longer have 
our familiar situation in 
which the time direction 
always lies within the 45- 
degree angle and space 
directions always lie outside 
it. 

Hawking sums up what 
we have just seen: 'In the 
very early universe, when 
space was very compressed, 



the smearing effect of the 
uncertainty principle can 
change the basic distinction 
between space and time.' It's 
no longer true that if points 
are farther apart in time than 
they are in space the square 
of their separation in four- 
dimensional spacetime (the 
square of the hypotenuse of 
our triangle) is necessarily a 
negative number. 'It is 
possible for the square of 



[that] separation to become 
positive under some 
circumstances. When this is 
the case, space and time lose 
their remaining distinction - 
we might say that time 
becomes fully spatialized - 
and it is then more accurate to 
talk, not of spacetime, but of 
a four-dimensional space. '- 



When Time Gets 



Spaced Out 

What would this look like? 
How is this odd situation of 
four-dimensional space going 
to join smoothly with 
spacetime as we know it, in 
which time flows as time? 
Using imaginary time it's 
possible to picture four- 
dimensional space, where 
time as we know it is non- 
existent, curving around and 
forming a closed surface, a 



surface without any edge or 
boundary. If you think you 
can picture this occurring in 
four dimensions, either 
you're mistaken or else 
you've taken a fresh 
evolutionary step in brain 
development. Most of us are 
doomed to think about it in 
fewer dimensions. It's easy to 
picture something with fewer 
dimensions that hasn't any 
edge or boundary: the surface 



of a ball or the surface of the 
Earth. 

In the first Friedmann 
model of the universe, the 
universe was finite, not 
infinite, in size. But in that 
model it was also unbounded. 
It had no boundaries, no 
edges in space. It was like the 
surface of a ball: no edge, but 
not infinite in size. Hawking 
thinks the universe may be 
finite and unbounded in space 



and time. Time may have no 
beginning or end. All of it 
comes around and forms a 
closed surface, like the 
surface of the Earth. 

This leaves us fairly 
helpless. We can picture the 
surface of the Earth, and we 
can agree that it is finite and 
unbounded, but what would a 
universe that is finite and 
unbounded in space and time 
be like? It's hard to make a 



mental connection between 
the shape of a ball and any 
meaningful concept of a four- 
dimensional universe. Just 
trying makes us feel quite 
blind - groping in the dark. 
Let's see what else we can 
say about it that might be 
helpful. 

First, we'll say what it 
would not be like. There 
would be no 'boundary 
conditions' - the way things 



were at the exact point of 
beginning - because there 
would be no point of 
beginning, no boundary, 
there. The whole thing would 
just curve around. Hawking 
suggests we state it exactly 
like that: the boundary 
conditions of the universe are 
that there are no boundaries. 
There would be no beginning 
and no end of the universe - 
anywhere. So don't even 



think of asking, But what 
about before that? That's like 
asking what's south of the 
South Pole. A signpost 
pointing 'south' has no 
meaning at the South Pole. 
An arrow of time indicating 
'this way to the past' has no 
meaning when the time 
dimension has become 
'spacey'. 

If there were no before 
and after the universe in the 



time dimension, would there 
be any 'elsewhere', any other 
place, any outside of such a 
universe in space 

dimensions? Hawking' s 
model doesn't say that there 
isn't. Can you have an 
outside when you don't have 
any boundary? In the ball 
model there is a sense in 
which we do. It's in the 
direction the ant on the 
surface of the balloon in 



Chapter 6 would see if it 
could look 'out' from the 
surface - which, you'll 
remember, it can't do. That 
dimension doesn't exist for 
the ant, but that doesn't 
necessarily mean it doesn't 
exist at all. The idea of 
having 'elsewheres' in space 
but none in time (no before or 
after) fits nicely with the idea 
that the time we live in is 
only a temporary mutation of 



what is really a fourth space 
dimension. 

Since all of this may seem 
too complicated to be 
meaningful, let's look at it in 
another, more practical, way. 
Ask again, What would a 
universe that is finite and 
unbounded in space and time 
be like? The calculations are 
extremely difficult. However, 
what they appear to be telling 
us is that a universe like that 



could be like our own. 

As Hawking described it: 

They predict that the 
universe must have 
started out in a fairly 
smooth and uniform 
state. It would have 
undergone a period of 
what is called 
exponential or 
'inflationary' 
expansion, during 



which its size would 
have increased by a 
very large factor but 
the density would 
have remained the 
same. The universe 
would then have 
become very hot and 
would have expanded 
to the state that we see 
it in today, cooling as 
it expanded. It would 
be uniform and the 



same 



m 



every 



direction on very large 
scales but would 



would develop into 
stars and galaxies. - 

In real time - and that's 
where we live - it would still 
appear to us that we have 
singularities at the beginning 
of the universe and inside 



contain 
irregularities 



local 
that 



black holes. 

Hawking and Jim Hartle 
presented the physics 
community with this no- 
boundary model of the 
universe in 1983. Hawking 
liked to emphasize that it was 
just a proposal. He hadn't 
deduced these boundary 
conditions from some other 
principle. The model 
appealed to him. He thought 
'that it really underlies 



science because it is really the 
statement that the laws of 
science hold every where '.- 
There are no singularities at 
which they break down. This 
kind of universe is self- 
contained. Do we have to 
explain how it was created? 
Would it have to be created at 
all? 'It would just BE,' writes 
Hawking. 7 



'What Place, Then, 



for a Creator?' 

This raises some sticky 
philosophical questions. As 
Hawking puts it, 'If the 
universe has no boundaries 
but is self-contained ... then 
God would not have had any 
freedom to choose how the 
universe began. '- 

Hawking hasn't said that 
the no-boundary proposal 
rules out the existence of 
God, only that God wouldn't 



have had any choice in how 
the universe began. Other 
scientists disagree. They 
don't think the no-boundary 
proposal limits God very 
much. If God had no choice, 
we still have to wonder who 
decided that God would have 
no choice. Perhaps, suggests 
the physicist Karel Kuchar, 
that was the choice God 
made. Don Page, who 
reviewed A Brief History oj 



Time for the journal Nature in 
England, has a similar 
viewpoint. Page, of course, 
was Hawking 's graduate 
assistant in the late 1970s. He 
had moved on to become a 
professor at the University of 
Alberta, Edmondton, Canada. 
He and Hawking were still 
good friends and were 
continuing to collaborate on 
scientific papers, and 
Hawking was well aware that 



Page was likely to come up 
with some arguments to 
refute the notion that the no- 
boundary proposal abolished 
the need for a Creator. Indeed 
he did. 

To Hawking 's question, 
'What place, then, for a 
Creator?', Page answered that 
in the Judeo-Christian view 
'God creates and sustains the 
entire Universe rather than 
just the beginning. Whether 



or not the Universe has a 
beginning has no relevance to 
the question of its creation, 
just as whether an artist's line 
has a beginning and an end, 
or instead forms a circle with 
no end, has no relevance to 
the question of its being 
drawn.'- A God existing 
outside our universe and our 
time wouldn't need a 
'beginning' in order to create, 
but it could still look to us, 



from our vantage point in 
'real' time, as though there 
had been a 'beginning'. 

In A Brief History of Time 
Hawking himself would 
suggest that there may still be 
a role for a Creator: 'Is the 
unified theory so compelling 
that it brings about its own 
existence?' If not, 'What is it 
that breathes fire into the 
equations and makes a 
universe for them to 



describe?'- In the book A 
Brief History of Time: A 
Reader's Companion, the 
companion book for the film, 
he would say that if the no- 
boundary proposal is correct, 
he will have succeeded in 
discovering how the universe 
began. 'But I still don't know 
why it began.'- He intended 
to find out, if he possibly 
could. 

All of which brings us to 



a word of caution: although 
theoretical physicists ask 
challenging, penetrating 
questions and present us with 
mind-blowing proposals and 
theories, they do not claim to 
give us 'ultimate answers' - 
even though the subtitle of a 
later book co-authored by 
Hawking might suggest that 
they do. The best science 
progresses by suggesting 
'answers' and then taking 



apart and disproving those 
'answers'. The most daring 
and imaginative scientists 
launch their toy boats and 
then, it seems, try extremely 
hard to make them sink. 

Hawking 's work is a 
prime example. First he 
proved that the universe had 
to start as a singularity. Then 
with his no-boundary 
proposal he showed us how 
there might be no singularity 



after all. In the meantime he 
told us that black holes could 
never get smaller, and then he 
discovered they could. His 
work on the Big Bang 
singularity seemed consistent 
with a biblical view of 
Creation, but his no-boundary 
proposal put the Creator out 
of a job or at least changed 
the job description. In A Brief 
History of Time he suggested 
that we might need the 



Creator after all, and 'the 
ultimate triumph of human 
reason' would be to 'know 
the mind of God'.- Hawking 
is provocative and open- 
minded in the way that the 
greatest thinkers have always 
been. He reaches clearly 
defined, well- supported 
conclusions, and then in the 
next breath he mercilessly 
questions and breaks down 
those same conclusions. He 



doesn't hesitate to admit that 
an earlier conclusion was 
incorrect or incomplete. 
That's the way his science - 
and perhaps all good science 
- advances, and one of the 
reasons why physics seems so 
full of paradoxes. 

In the process, Hawking 
has supplied eloquent 
quotations that can be used to 
support opposing 
philosophical points of view. 



He's been quoted and 
misquoted by those who 
believe in God and those who 
do not. He's been the hero 
and villain of both camps. 
However, those who depend 
on his statements or 
statements of other scientists 
- to support their belief or 
unbelief risk having the rug 
swept out from under them at 
any moment. 

Meanwhile, although it 



may appear to us that 
Hawking completely reversed 
himself with the no-boundary 
proposal, he didn't see it that 
way. He said that the most 
important thing about his 
work on singularities was that 
it showed that a gravitational 
field must become so strong 
that you can't ignore quantum 
effects. And when you stop 
ignoring quantum effects, you 
find out that the universe 



could be finite in imaginary 
time but have no boundaries 
or singularities. 

Inflation Gets 
Chaotic 

In 1983, the same year that 
Hawking and Jim Hartle 
published their no-boundary 
proposal, Andrei Linde 
solved some of the still 
nagging problems of inflation 



theory with a new suggestion. 
The first person in the West 
to whom he mentioned 
'chaotic inflation' was 
Hawking. Hawking was 
enthusiastic. 

Both 'old' and 'new' 
inflation had assumed that 
inflation was just an 
intermediate short phase in 
the history of the early 
universe, that the universe 
was in a state of thermal 



equilibrium (meaning it was 
the same temperature 
everywhere) before inflation 
started, relatively 
homogeneous and large 
enough to survive until the 
inflation process got 
underway. Linde abandoned 
these assumptions in his 
chaotic inflation scenario, 
which didn't require thermal 
equilibrium, and in which 
inflation could begin earlier, 



closer to the Big Bang. 

The universe before the 
inflationary period could have 
been in a chaotic state. All 
that was needed was for 
minuscule parts of that chaos 
to be able to inflate, 
becoming smoother and more 
isotropic— as they did so, like 
balloons that started out as 
crinkly pieces of rubber and 
ended up smooth balls. For 
all we know, only one tiny 



part of the chaos did that, 
though that is probably not 
likely. In any event, our 
balloon, as it inflated, pushed 
other inflating bits far out of 
range of our potential sight. 
Maybe other parts of the 
universe are still chaotic. Or 
maybe everything is smooth 
everywhere. 

In chaotic inflation there 
is no phase transition or 
supercooling at all. Instead, 



there is a field that has large 
values in some regions of the 
universe, while not in others, 
a kind of 'lucky negligence of 
the Creator', as Linde puts 
it— The energy in the regions 
with large values, Linde was 
thinking, would be great 
enough to have a repulsive 
gravitational effect, causing 
them to expand in an 
inflationary way, while in the 
regions of the field where the 



values were too small this 
could not happen. Inflation in 
the regions where it did 
happen would create 
enormous homogeneous 
islands out of the original 
chaos, each one much larger 
than our observable universe. 
In these regions, the energy 
of the field would decrease 
slowly and, in some of them, 
eventually allow the 
expansion to reach the rate of 



expansion that we observe. 
Have a sufficient number of 
these regions around and we 
are highly likely to find one 
where the conditions were 
such as to produce a universe 
like the one we know, with 
the constants of nature that 
are arbitrary elements in our 
theories set just right to allow 
for the eventual existence of 
you and me. Maybe only one 
- in which case that one is 



ours. 

A satisfying resolution to 
the story, but ... not the end 
of it. Chaotic inflation theory 
also predicted a 'second stage 
of inflation', occurring much 
later - a speeding up of the 
expansion of the universe ... 
perhaps in our own modern 
era. In the early eighties, that 
idea sounded like science 
fiction, even to Andrei Linde 
and Stephen Hawking. We 



will see that by the end of the 
century it would no longer be 
science fiction. 

Meanwhile, the most 
remarkable aspect of inflation 
theory as it was beginning to 
be thought of in the early 
1980s was that though 
theorists still had different 
ideas about the way inflation 
happened, there was 
agreement that the whole 
visible universe that we know 



today could have begun from 
a much smaller irregularity of 
mass and energy than anyone 
had imagined possible. As 
John Barrow phrased it in The 
Book of Universes'. 'Instead 
of eradicating [irregularities], 
inflation just swept them 
beyond the visible horizon in 
the universe today. They will 
still be there somewhere far 
away but the whole of our 
visible universe reflects the 



high isotropy and smoothness 
of a tiny patch of space that 
underwent inflation.' 14 

Our universe is not, of 
course, completely smooth. 
We have solar systems, 
galaxies and galaxy clusters. 
Even immediately following 
inflation, the bit that would 
eventually expand to be our 
visible universe must not 
have been as perfectly 
smooth as the imagined 



inflated balloon might 
suggest. It would be stretched 
out, but not so much as to 
avoid still having small 
variations that would have 
provided the seeds that could 
grow into all that astounding 
structure - large-scale 
modern variations in density 
indeed. 

As early as the conference 
Hawking and Gibbons 
organized in Cambridge in 



the summer of 1982, the 
participants realized that 
inflation would have 
produced a particular pattern 
of variations.- This would 
show up as a recognizable 
pattern of variation in the 
cosmic microwave 
background radiation. 
Observations at that time 
were not able to show any 
such pattern. Nevertheless, in 
the case for and against 



inflation, though no one could 
ever be an eye witness to the 
events with which our 
universe began, there was 
hope that there might 
someday be some evidence to 
show whether inflation 
theorists had it right. 

fnl Isotropy is the quality of 
being the same in all 
directions. 



11 



'It's turtles all the way 
down' 



lucy was eleven years old 
and completing her final year 
at Newnham Croft Primary 
School in the spring of 1982. 
She and her parents had 



decided that the best choice 
for the next stage of her 
education was the Perse 
School for Girls in 
Cambridge. Her brother 
Robert had been attending the 
Perse School for Boys since 
he was seven. In the 1960s a 
practical need for a job, so 
that he could get married, had 
sent Hawking off searching 
for singularities. This time, 
another practical need - for 



funds to pay Lucy's school 
fees - launched him into a 
new enterprise that was to 
have a far-reaching impact on 
the Hawkings and others all 
over the world. It all began 
with Hawking 's decision to 
try to earn the money by 
writing a book about the 
universe - not an academic 
book but a book directed to 
people without a scientific 
education. 



There had, of course, 
been other popular books 
about the universe and black 
holes. However, Hawking 
thought none of them spoke 
enough about the most 
interesting questions, the 
questions that had made him 
want to study cosmology and 
quantum theory: Where did 
the universe come from? 
How and why did it begin? 
Will it come to an end and, if 



so, how? Is there a complete 
theory of the universe and 
everything in it? Are we close 
to finding that theory? Is 
there a need for a Creator? 

These were questions that 
he thought should interest 
everybody, not only 
scientists. However, science 
had become so technical and 
specialized that the general 
public was left out of the 
discussion. The trick in 



writing the book would be to 
make it understandable to 
non-scientists, and that meant 
using virtually no 
mathematics. He set to work 
dictating and completed the 
first draft in 1984. 

Because it was a great 
deal of trouble dictating a 
book of this length, Hawking 
wanted the book to reach as 
many people as possible. His 
earlier books had been 



published by Cambridge 
University Press, one of the 
most prestigious academic 
publishers in the world, but 
after discussing his proposed 
new book with them and 
hearing them predict that it 
might sell 20,000 copies a 
year worldwide, Hawking 
decided he might do better 
with a publisher more attuned 
to the mass popular market. 
He wanted to see his book in 



airport bookstalls. His 
American agent discouraged 
this hope. Academics and 
students would buy the book, 
but the popular market, not 
likely. Hawking thought 
otherwise. 

Several British publishers 
turned down the proposal, a 
decision they would regret. 1 
But there were some offers. 
One of the most surprising 
came from Bantam. Against 



the advice of his agent, 
Hawking chose them. Bantam 
might not have specialized in 
publishing science books, but 
they sold many, many books 
in airports. Bantam in the 
United States paid $250,000 
for the American rights, and 
Bantam-Trans world in the 
UK offered £30,000 for the 
British. Paying that much for 
a science book was a gamble 
- one of the best gambles 



either publisher ever made. 

A Year on the Brink 

1985 was a difficult year for 
the Hawking family. That 
summer, the plan was for 
Hawking to spend a month in 
Geneva at CERN. He was 
looking forward, among other 
things, to exploring the 
implications of some recent 
calculations by Don Page and 
Raymond LaFlamme having 



to do with arrows of time. 
Hawking, his nurses, his 
secretary Laura Gentry, and 
some of his students left 
Cambridge and travelled 
directly to Switzerland while 
Jane, Jonathan, Lucy and Tim 
took a more circuitous and 
adventurous route, camping 
across Belgium and 
Germany. They were to meet 
Stephen at the Bayreuth 
Festival and scrub up from 



campsite to formal standard 
to attend Wagner's Ring 
cycle. At the time everyone 
was more concerned about 
Robert, who was trekking 
across Iceland and canoeing 
its northern coastline on a 
Venture Scout expedition, 
than they were about Stephen 
in safe, healthy Switzerland. 2 
On the eve of their arrival 
in Bayreuth, Jane found a 
public phone in Mannheim 



and rang her husband in 
Switzerland to arrange the 
schedule for the next day. A 
very distraught Laura Gentry 
answered the phone and 
urged her to come to Geneva 
at once. Stephen was in 
hospital with pneumonia. The 
situation looked grave. Jane 
arrived there to find Laura's 
distress well warranted. He 
was on a life- support system, 
in an induced coma, barely 



hanging on to life. 

Knowing Hawking 's 
physical future with ALS, but 
not aware of his fierce 
determination to live, doctors 
gave Jane the choice whether 
to have him disconnected 
from life support and allowed 
to die. This was a 
heartbreaking situation. The 
only way to save his life 
would be to perform a 
tracheotomy. Afterwards, 



there would be no more 
problems with coughing and 
choking, but he would never 
again be able to speak or 
make any vocal sound. That 
seemed a ghastly price to pay. 
Hawking 's speech was slow 
and difficult to understand, 
but it was still speech, and his 
only possible means of 
communication. Without it, 
he couldn't continue his 
career or even converse. 



What would survival be 
worth to him? Nevertheless, 
Jane remembers that her 
decision was 'clear and 
unequivocal, pronounced 
without a second thought, that 
Stephen must live, despite the 
prognosis of likely 
complications ahead' given 
her by the doctors, for as his 
wife she saw herself 'as the 
agent of life, not death'.- 'The 
future looked very, very 



bleak,' she recalls. 'We didn't 
know how we were going to 
be able to survive - or if he 
was going to survive. It was 
my decision ... but I have 
sometimes thought - what 
have I done? What sort of life 
have I let him in for?'- 

When Hawking was 
strong enough, the University 
of Cambridge paid for an air 
ambulance to fly him back to 
Cambridge, where he was 



admitted to intensive care in 
Addenbrooke's Hospital. 
Doctors made a final attempt 
to avoid the operation, but 
efforts to wean him off the 
respirator brought back the 
choking fits. A tracheotomy 
was the only way to proceed. 
Hawking remembers the 
vivid dreams he had during 
this time of flying in a hot-air 
balloon. He decided to take 
this as a symbol of hope. 



Recovering slowly in the 
hospital, Hawking no longer 
breathed through his mouth 
and nose but through a small 
permanent opening made in 
his throat at about the height 
of his shirt collar. The only 
way he could communicate 
was to spell out words letter 
by letter by raising his 
eyebrows when someone 
pointed to the right letter on a 
spelling card. 



After several weeks in 
intensive care, Hawking was 
allowed to come home on 
Sunday afternoons. Jane was 
determined that he would stay 
with her and their children 
and Jonathan rather than live 
in a nursing home. Since 
1980, the community and 
private nurses arranged by 
Martin Rees had been coming 
for an hour or two each 
morning and evening to 



supplement the care given by 
Jane, the graduate assistant 
and Jonathan. However, from 
now on for as long as he 
lived, Hawking would need 
round-the-clock nurses. The 
cost was astronomical, far 
beyond the Hawkings' 
resources. The National 
Health Service, which in 
Britain is paid for out of 
public funds, would have paid 
for a nursing home but could 



only offer a few hours' 
nursing care in the Hawkings' 
home plus help with bathing. 
'There was absolutely no way 
we could finance nursing at 
home,' Jane says.- Not only 
Hawking 's work as a 
physicist but any sort of 
meaningful life at all seemed 
at an end. It was an end 
they'd expected to come 
much sooner, but it was no 
less bitter for all that. 



'At times things have 
looked absolutely dire for us 
and then something has come 
out of those crises,'- Jane has 
commented, recovering some 
of the optimism with which 
she had begun their marriage. 
Kip Thorne in California 
received word of his friend's 
plight and immediately got in 
touch with Jane and 
suggested that she try to get 
funding from the John D. and 



Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation. Another friend, 
particle physicist Murray 
Gell-Mann, was on their 
board. The MacArthur 
Foundation agreed to help on 
a trial basis at first, with a 
grant to cover nursing care. 
More than three months after 
Hawking had entered the 
hospital, he came home to 
West Road in early 
November. 



An unexpected ray of 
hope on the bleak horizon 
came when a computer expert 
in California, Walt Woltosz, 
sent a computer program he'd 
written for his disabled 
mother-in-law. 'Equalizer' 
allowed the user to select 
words from the computer 
screen and also had a built-in 
speech synthesizer. One of 
Hawking 's students devised 
an implement something like 



a computer mouse, so that 
Hawking could operate the 
program by a tiny movement 
that was still possible for him: 
squeezing this switch held in 
his hand. Should that fail him, 
head or eye movement could 
activate the switch. 

Still too weak and ill to 
resume his research, Hawking 
practised with his computer. 
The first message he 
produced, after managing to 



make the computer say 
'Hello' in the synthesized 
voice that was destined to 
become familiar all over the 
world, was to ask his 
graduate assistant, Brian 
Whitt, to help him finish 
writing his popular-level 
book. 2 That would have to 
wait until he was more 
proficient with Equalizer, but 
before long he could produce 
ten words a minute, not very 



fast but good enough to 
convince him that he could 
continue his career. 'It was a 
bit slow,' he says, 'but then I 
think slowly, so it suited me 
quite well.' Later, his speed 
improved. He was for a time 
able to produce more than 
fifteen words a minute. 

Here's how the process 
worked, and still does, with a 
few modifications. The 
vocabulary programmed into 



the computer contains around 
2,500 words, about two 
hundred of them specialized 
scientific terms. A screen full 
of words appears. The top 
half of the screen and the 
bottom half are highlighted 
alternately, back and forth, 
until Hawking sees the half- 
screen that includes the word 
he's looking for highlighted, 
and squeezes the switch in his 
hand to choose that half- 



screen. Then lines of words 
on that half- screen are 
highlighted one after the 
other. When the line with the 
word he wants is highlighted, 
Hawking squeezes the switch 
again. The words on that line 
are then highlighted one by 
one. When the word he wants 
is highlighted, he presses the 
switch again. Sometimes he 
misses and the words or lines 
have to start over. There are a 



few often-used phrases, such 
as 'Please turn the page', 
'Please switch on the desk 
computer', an alphabet for 
spelling out words not 
included in the program, and, 
I am told, a special file of 
insulting remarks, though I 
haven't seen him use that. 

Hawking selects the 
words one by one to make a 
sentence, which appears 
across the lower part of the 



screen. He can send the result 
to a speech synthesizer, 
which pronounces it out loud 
or over the telephone. (One 
strange fault with the process 
is that it cannot pronounce the 
word photon correctly, but 
always comes out with foe- 
t'n.) He can also save 
something on a disk and later 
print it out or rework it. He 
has a formatting program for 
writing papers, and he writes 



out his equations in words, 
which the program translates 
into symbols. 

Hawking writes his 
lectures this way and saves 
them on disks. He can listen 
ahead of time to the speech 
synthesizer deliver a lecture, 
then edit and polish it. Before 
an audience he sends his 
lecture to the speech 
synthesizer a sentence at a 
time. An assistant shows 



slides, writes Hawking 's 
equations on the board, and 
answers some of the 
questions. 

Hawking ' s synthesized 
computer voice varies the 
intonation and doesn't sound 
like a monotonal robot, which 
to him is an extremely 
important feature. At first he 
wished it gave him a British 
accent, but after a while he 
became so identified with it 



that 'I would not want to 
change even if I were offered 
a British sounding voice. I 
would feel I had become a 
different person.'- Just what 
accent it does give him is 
uncertain. Some people say 
it's American or 

Scandinavian. To me it 
sounds East Indian, perhaps 
because of its slightly musical 
inflection. Hawking can't 
inject emotion into the voice. 



The effect is measured, 
thoughtful, detached. 
Hawking 's son Tim thinks his 
father's voice suits him. Tim 
of all the children is least able 
to remember what Hawking 's 
own voice sounded like. 
When he was born in 1979, 
there was little of that left. 

Does all of this make 
conversation with Hawking 
seem like talking to a 
machine - like something 



alien, from science fiction? 
At first just a little. Soon you 
forget all about it. Hawking is 
comfortable with the odd 
situation and patient when 
others are not. When he was 
reading parts of this book 
while I held the pages, it was 
his nurse, not he, who 
suggested that it was 
unnecessary for me to wait 
for Hawking to select 'Please 
turn the page', which 



involved a number of 
manoeuvres on the computer 
screen. As soon as he started 
clicking, she said, I could turn 
the page and save him trouble 
and time. He'd put up with 
my way of doing things for 
an hour and a half without 
indicating that I was in any 
way inconveniencing him. As 
it happened, the next time 
Hawking 'clicked' and I 
turned the page, he was 



making a comment, not 
asking for a page turn. 

Hawking 's sense of 
humour is contagious and 
likely to break out at any 
moment. However, when one 
interviewer commented to 
Hawking that it must be 
frustrating, telling jokes and 
having your listeners 
anticipate the punchline 
before you have a chance to 
crack it, Hawking admitted 



that 'I often find that by the 
time I have written 
something, the conversation 
has moved on to another 
subject.'- Nevertheless, when 
his face lights up with a 
smile, it is difficult to believe 
this man has many problems. 
The Hawking grin is famous, 
and it reveals the quality of 
his love for his subject. It's a 
grin that says, 'This is all 
very impressive and serious, 



but - ain't it fun!' 

It is, of course, nothing 
short of miraculous that 
Hawking has been able to 
achieve everything he has, 
even that he's still alive. 
However, when you meet him 
and experience his 
intelligence and humour, you 
begin to take his unusual 
mode of communication and 
his obviously catastrophic 
physical problems no more 



seriously than he seems to 
himself. That is the way he 
wants it. He chooses to ignore 
the difficulty, 'not think about 
my condition, or regret the 
things it prevents me from 
doing, which are not that 
many.'— He expects others to 
adopt the same attitude. 



1985-1986 

In the autumn of 1985, with 
the Equalizer raising 



Hawking 's hopes of getting 
on with his career and his 
popular-level book, Jane and 
Laura Gentry interviewed and 
hired the twenty-four-hour 
nursing staff who were going 
to make life at home possible. 
There would be three shifts a 
day, and the nurses had to be 
trained medical professionals. 
The tube that had been 
inserted in his throat had to 
be suctioned out regularly 



with a 'mini- vacuum cleaner' 
so that secretions would not 
accumulate in his lungs. The 
'mini-vacuum cleaner' itself 
could be a source of infection 
and cause damage if not used 
correctly.- Not everyone they 
interviewed wanted this kind 
of demanding work, and there 
were also a few false starts. 

One applicant who was 
eager to have the job and 
willing to dedicate herself to 



it long term was Elaine 
Mason, a physically strong, 
athletic woman with a zany 
sense of humour and a 
wonderful taste for colours 
that showed off her red hair. 
She impressed Jane as a 
caring person. Born Elaine 
Sybil Lawson in Hereford, 
Elaine was a devout 
Evangelical Christian whose 
father, Henry Lawson, had 
been a clergyman in the 



Church of England and 
whose mother had a medical 
degree. Elaine had worked for 
four years in an orphanage in 
Bangladesh, then come back 
to England and married 
David Mason, a computer 
engineer. They had two sons, 
one about the age of Tim 
Hawking. 

I knew Elaine and David 
Mason and their sons only as 
a family with children in the 



same school as ours, but I 
remember that on parents' 
day I competed successfully 
with Elaine in the egg-and- 
spoon race. She was reputed 
to be fiercely competitive, but 
that wasn't evident in this 
particular sport. She seemed a 
refreshingly irrepressible, 
uninhibited woman. 

Stephen ' s and Jane ' s 
hiring of Elaine became a 
fortuitous choice when her 



husband adapted a small 
computer and speech 
synthesizer and attached it to 
Hawking ' s wheelchair. 
Before that Hawking could 
run the Equalizer only on his 
desktop computer. Now his 
voice could go with him 
wherever he went. David 
Mason, like his wife, was 
devoted to Hawking. 'If he 
raised an eyebrow, you would 
run a mile,' he said.- 



The Hawking household 
adapted to the new tensions 
of living a much less private 
life, in what seemed like a 
small-scale hospital with 
strangers abroad in it twenty- 
four hours a day. Hawking 
managed to recover enough 
strength and to handle the 
Equalizer program well 
enough to return to his office 
before Christmas. There were 
no more solo trips across the 



Backs; a nurse went with 
him. In many ways, things 
were looking up. His son 
Robert received his A-level 
exam results and, to 
everyone's relief, they were 
excellent. Cambridge would 
accept Robert for the 
following autumn, to read 
natural science as his father 
had at Oxford. 

By the spring of 1986, life 
had begun to settle into a 



new, rather optimistic status 
quo, with one sad break in 
March when Frank Hawking, 
Stephen's father, died. 
Hawking' s mother Isobel has 
said that Hawking was 'very 
upset by his father's death - it 
was rather a dreadful thing. 
He was very fond of his 
father, but they had grown 
apart rather and hadn't seen a 
great deal of each other in the 
late years.'- Hawking, of 



course, soldiered on. Soon he 
resumed his travels. His first 
trip away, to a conference in 
Sweden, was a success in 
more ways than one. Murray 
Gell-Mann was another 
attendee and witnessed first 
hand Hawking 's ability to 
take a full part in the 
conference - evidence of how 
well the MacArthur funds 
were being put to work. 
Jane's application in October 



for an extension of the 
funding was approved. Now 
it would cover medical 
expenses as well as nurses on 
a continuing basis. 

The Assault on the 
Airport Bookshops 

Having mastered the 
Equalizer program, Hawking 
went back to work on his 
popular-level book in the 



spring of 1986. It hadn't 
taken him long, 

characteristically, to begin to 
regard the new level of 
disability as an advantage 
rather than a calamity. 'In 
fact,' said Hawking, 'I can 
communicate better now than 
before I lost my voice.'- That 
statement is often quoted as 
an example of raw courage. It 
was, in fact, the simple truth. 
He no longer needed to 



dictate or speak through an 
'interpreter'. 

Bantam had accepted 
Hawking 's first draft for the 
book in the summer of 1985, 
but, with his catastrophic 
health problems, there had 
been no opportunity to move 
forward with the project. In 
any case, moving forward 
was not going to be an easy 
task. Bantam was insisting on 
some revisions. Hawking 



ended up almost completely 
rewriting his first draft. 

He knew that even in non- 
technical language the 
concepts in his book would 
not be easy for most people. 
He claims he is not overly 
fond of equations himself, in 
spite of the fact that people 
compare his ability to handle 
them in his head to Mozart's 
mentally composing a whole 
symphony. It is difficult for 



him to write equations, even 
though the Equalizer allows 
him to express them in words 
and then rewrites them with 
symbols. He says he has no 
intuitive feeling for them. As 
Kip Thorne pointed out, he 
likes to think instead in 
pictures. This, in fact, seemed 
an excellent method for the 
book: to describe his mental 
images in words, helped 
along with familiar analogies 



and a few diagrams. 

Hawking 's and his 
graduate assistant Whitt's 
mode of operation fell into a 
pattern. Hawking would 
explain something in 
scientific language and then 
realize that his readers would 
not understand. He and Whitt 
would try to think of an 
analogy, but neither was 
willing to use analogies 
willy-nilly without being 



certain they were truly valid. 
Making sure of their validity 
occasioned lengthy 
discussions. Hawking 
wondered just how much to 
explain. Were some 
complicated matters better 
glossed over and left at that? 
Would explaining too much 
lead to confusion? Ultimately 
Hawking explained a great 
deal. 

His editor at Bantam, 



Peter Guzzardi, wasn't a 
scientist. He felt that 
whatever he couldn't 
understand in the manuscript 
needed rewriting. He pointed 
out something that Hawking 's 
students and colleagues had 
sometimes complained about: 
Hawking often jumped from 
thought to thought and came 
to surprising conclusions, 
wrongly assuming others 
could see the connections. 



Some attributed this to 
Hawking 's need to use few 
words, but the reason went 
deeper than that, and his 
scientific colleagues were 
experiencing something of 
the same jumps on a far more 
advanced level than Peter 
Guzzardi. Whitt said that 
sometimes Hawking would 
tell him that something must 
be so 'because of what I 
understand', not because he 



could prove it or explain how 
he arrived there. Brian would 
do the calculations and 
sometimes have to report to 
Hawking that he had been 
wrong, and Hawking would 
not believe him. Then after 
some consideration and 
talking about it, Brian would 
realize that Hawking was 
right after all. 'His hunch was 
better than my calculation. I 
think that's a very important 



aspect of his mind: the ability 
to think ahead rather than go 
step by step; to jump the 
simple calculations and just 
come up with a conclusion. '— 
Nevertheless, for Hawking' s 
editor Guzzardi, jumping the 
connections between his 
conclusions wasn't 
acceptable for a popular-level 
book. Even when Hawking 
felt he'd explained simply, 
Guzzardi often found the 



explanation unfathomable. At 
one point, Bantam tactfully 
suggested having an 
experienced science writer 
write the book for Hawking. 
Hawking vehemently rejected 
that idea. The revision 
process became tedious. Each 
time Hawking submitted a 
rewritten chapter, Guzzardi 
sent back a lengthy list of 
objections and questions. 
Hawking was irritated, but in 



the end he admitted that his 
editor was right. 'It is a much 
better book as a result,' he 
said. 1 - 6 

Editors at Cambridge 
University Press who had 
seen Hawking' s book 
proposal had warned him that 
every equation he used would 
cut book sales in half. 
Guzzardi agreed. Hawking 
eventually decided he would 
include only one equation: 



Einstein's E=mc 2 . Guzzardi 
prevailed in a disagreement 
about the title. When 
Hawking got nervous about 
the use of the word 'brief, 
Guzzardi replied that he liked 
it very much, it made him 
smile. That argument won the 
day. The title would be A 
Brief History of Time. The 
second draft was finally 
completed a year after they 
had begun working on it, in 



the spring of 1987. 

By then, Hawking was 
also fully involved in the 
physics world again, 
continuing his career and 
gathering more honours and 
awards. In October 1986 he 
had received an appointment 
to the Pontifical Academy of 
Sciences, and the whole 
Hawking family had an 
audience with the Pope. He 
was awarded the first Paul 



Dirac Medal from the 
Institute of Physics. In June 
and July 1987, after the final 
draft of A Brief History of 
Time was completed, 
Cambridge hosted an 
international conference to 
celebrate the 300th 
anniversary of the publication 
of Isaac Newton's Principia 
Mathematica, one of the most 
significant books in the 
history of science. Hawking 



was instrumental in bringing 
this event about. In 
connection with it, he and 
Werner Israel solicited 
articles from leaders in the 
fields connected with 
gravitation and put together 
the splendid book 300 Years 
of Gravitation. 12 

When A Brief History oj 
Time was nearing publication, 
in the early spring of 1988, 
Don Page was sent an 



advance copy to review for 
the journal Nature. Page was 
appalled to find it full of 
errors: photographs and 
diagrams in the wrong places 
and wrongly labelled. He 
placed an urgent call to 
Bantam. Bantam editors 
decided to recall and scrap 
the entire printing. Then 
began the intense process of 
correcting and republishing 
the book in time to have it in 



bookshops by the April 
publication date in the United 
States. Page now believes he 
owns one of the few extant 
copies of the original printing 
of Hawking 's book. That 
copy is probably quite 
valuable. 

Hawking enjoys pointing 
out that the American edition 
of A Brief History of Time: 
From the Big Bang to Black 
Holes was published on April 



Fool's Day, 1988. The British 
edition was launched at a 
luncheon at the Royal Society 
on 16 June. The Hawkings 
watched, astounded, as the 
book climbed effortlessly to 
the top of the bestseller lists. 
There it stayed week after 
unlikely week, then month 
after month, soon selling a 
million copies in America. In 
Britain the publisher could 
barely keep enough books on 



the shelves to meet the 
demand. Translations into 
other languages quickly 
followed. The book was 
indeed prominently displayed 
in airport bookstalls, and 
Hawking had to face the 
difficulty of getting his 
speech synthesizer to 
pronounce the word 
'Guinness' when he and his 
book made the Guinness 
Book of World Records. It 



insisted on saying 'Guy- 
ness'. 'Maybe it is because it 
is an American speech 
synthesizer,' Hawking 
quipped. 'If only I had an 
Irish one . . . '— 

Perhaps thanks to his 
persistent editor, Hawking 
had succeeded in making it 
possible (though not always 
easy) to follow him logically 
from thought to thought, 
sometimes even to anticipate 



him. This was a book to be 
studied, if you didn't have a 
scientific background, not 
read quickly. It was well 
worth the effort, and it was 
also good entertainment. 
Hawking 's humour makes A 
Brief History of Time in its 
way a romp through the 
history of time, not safe to 
read in any situation where it 
would be awkward to burst 
out laughing. 



Stephen Hawking rapidly 
became a household word 
and a popular hero all over 
the world. Fans organized a 
club in Chicago and printed 
Hawking T-shirts. One 
member admitted that some 
of his school friends thought 
this Hawking on his T-shirt 
must be a rock star; a few 
even claimed to have his 
latest album. 

Reviews were favourable. 



One compared the book to 
Zen and the Art of Motorcycle 
Maintenance. Jane Hawking 
was horrified, but Stephen 
Hawking declared he was 
flattered, that this meant his 
book 'gives people the 
feeling that they need not be 
cut off from the great 
intellectual and philosophical 
questions'. - 

Did people who bought 
the book read it and 



understand it? Some critics 
suggested that most of those 
who purchased it never read it 
and, if they tried, couldn't 
possibly understand it. They 
just wanted it to be seen on 
their coffee table. Hawking 
lashed back rather forcefully 
in the foreword to A Brief 
History of Time: A Reader's 
Companion: 6 I think some 
critics are rather patronizing 
to the general public. They 



feel that they, the critics, are 
very clever people, and if 
they can't understand my 
book completely then 
ordinary mortals have no 
chance.'- He wasn't overly 
concerned about its being left 
on coffee tables and 
bookcases just for show. The 
Bible and Shakespeare, he 
pointed out, have shared that 
fate for centuries. 
Nevertheless, he thought lots 



of people read his book, 
because he got mounds of 
letters about it. Many asked 
questions and made detailed 
comments. He was often 
stopped by strangers in the 
street who said how much 
they enjoyed it; this pleased 
him immensely but 
embarrassed his son Timmy. 

Hawking ' s increasing 
celebrity status and the need 
to publicize the book gave 



him even more opportunities 
for travel than before. A 
Hawking visit usually left his 
hosts exhausted. The 
Rockefeller Institute in New 
York was the scene of one 
such occasion. After a long 
day of lectures and public 
appearances, there was a 
banquet in Hawking 's 
honour. Hawking relished 
such events and made a show 
of sniffing the wine and 



commenting on it. Dinner and 
speeches over, the party 
moved to the embankment 
overlooking the East River. 
Everyone was petrified lest 
Hawking roll into the river. 
To their relief he didn't, and 
they soon had him safely 
headed back towards his 
hotel. In a ballroom opening 
off the lobby, a dance was 
going on. Hawking insisted 
that they not retire yet but 



crash the party. Unable to 
dissuade their headstrong 
honoree, the little group of 
distinguished scholars 
hesitatingly agreed, 'although 
we never do anything like 
that!' On the dance floor 
Hawking twirled about in his 
wheelchair with one partner 
after another. The band went 
on playing for him far into 
the night, long after the 
original party was over. 



Would Hawking write a 
sequel to his book? Asked 
that frequently, he answered 
that he thought not. 'What 
would I call it? A Longer 
History of Time? Beyond the 
End of Time? Son of Time?'— 
Perhaps A Brief History oj 
Time II - 'just when you 
thought it was safe to go back 
into the airport bookstore!' 
Would he write his 
autobiography? Not until he 



runs out of money to pay his 
nurses, or so he told me. That 
was not likely to be soon. 
Time magazine announced in 
August 1990 that A Brief 
History of Time had so far 
sold over 8 million copies, 
and they were still selling. If 
only he had left out that one 
equation! 

Some accused Bantam 
and Hawking of exploiting 
Hawking 's condition in 



marketing the book. They 
sniffed that his fame and 
popularity were like a 
carnival sideshow and blamed 
Hawking for allowing an 
overdramatic, grotesque 
picture to appear on the book 
cover. Hawking rejoined that 
his contract gave him 
absolutely no control over the 
cover. He did persuade the 
publisher to use a better 
picture on the British edition. 



On the plus side, the 
media exposure allowed 
Hawking to give the world 
something that may be at 
least as valuable as his 
scientific theories and the 
information that the universe 
is probably not 'turtles all the 
way down'.— It brought to 
millions not only his keen 
excitement about his work 
but also the important 
reminder that there is a 



profound kind of health 
which transcends the 
boundaries of any illness. 

For the Hawkings the 
success of the book brought 
more than a change in 
financial status, making 
Hawking into what CAM 
magazine called 'that rarest of 
phenomena, a Labour-voting 
multi-millionaire ' .— For 
years, he and Jane and their 
children had lived with 



disability and the threat of 
death. As Jane Hawking 
described it: 'In a sense 
we've always been living on 
the edge of the precipice, and 
eventually you put down 
roots at the edge of the 
precipice. I think that's what 
we've done.'- Now they 
found themselves threatened 
in a different way, by the 
allure and demands of 
celebrity and the frightening 



prospect of living up to a 
worldwide fairy-tale image. 

In the mid- to late 1980s, 
it was often Elaine Mason 
who accompanied Hawking 
in his travels, and their 
growing fondness for one 
another was evident in a 
series of photographs taken 
by a friend of Elaine's, New 
York photographer Miriam 
Berkeley. Unfortunately, 
Elaine's fierce loyalty to 



Hawking, her protectiveness, 
her jealously guarded 
relationship with him and the 
strength of her personality 
were beginning not to sit so 
well with his family, others of 
his nurses and carers, or with 
colleagues and staff in the 
DAMTP. But her relationship 
with Hawking was a special 
relationship that was not 
going to evaporate any time 
soon. Others were competent 



and sympathetic, but it was 
Elaine he preferred to have 
with him as much as possible. 

fnl In his book A Brief 
History of Time Hawking 
retold the story of an elderly 
lady who rose at the end of a 
scientific lecture to take 
exception with the speaker 
and insist that the world is a 
plate supported on the back of 
a giant turtle. When the 



speaker asked what she 
thought the turtle was 
standing on, she replied that 
he was very clever to ask that 
question, but in fact it was 
'turtles all the way down'.

The field of baby 
universes is in its 
infancy' 

AS EARLY as the 1970s, 
magazine articles and 
television specials had told 
Stephen Hawking 's story. In 



the late 1980s, after the 
publication of A Brief History 
of Time, virtually every 
periodical in the world 
profiled him. Reporters and 
photographers greeted him 
everywhere. 'courageous 

PHYSICIST KNOWS THE MIND OF 

god', blared the headlines. 
His picture was on the cover 
of Newsweek with the words 
'master of the universe' 
emblazoned across a dramatic 



background of stars and 
nebulae. In 1989 he and his 
family were interviewed for 
ABC's show 20/20, and in 
England a new television 
special appeared: Master of 
the Universe: Stephen 
Hawking. He was no longer 
merely well-known and 
successful. He'd become an 
idol, a superstar, in a class 
with sports heroes and rock 
musicians. 



Jane Hawking spoke of 
her 'sense of fulfilment that 
we have been able to remain 
a united family, that the 
children are absolutely superb 
and that Stephen is still able 
to live at home and do his 
work'. 1 The world at large 
knew nothing about Jonathan 
Hellyer Jones or Elaine 
Mason and it seemed 
advisable to keep it that way. 

The academic awards 



kept pouring in: five more 
honorary degrees and seven 
more international awards. 
One of them was the 1988 
Wolf Prize, awarded by the 
Wolf Foundation of Israel 
and recognized as second in 
prestige only to the Nobel 
Prize in Physics. Another 
Cambridge luminary, 
Christopher Polge, won the 
Wolf Prize for Agriculture 
the same year, and he and his 



wife Olive and the Hawkings 
often found themselves feted 
together. Stephen replied to 
one interviewer that he did 
not 'believe in God; there is 
no room for God in my 
universe', a statement that 
Jane found particularly 
hurtful because they were in 
Jerusalem, a city with deep 
spiritual significance for her. 

By this time Robert 
Hawking was a university 



student, studying physics and 
rowing for his Cambridge 
college, Corpus Christi. One 
of the television specials 
showed him racing on the 
river while the rest of the 
family, including Hawking 
with his synthetic voice, 
cheered from the bank. Lucy 
was considering a career in 
the theatre. She appeared in 
the Cambridge Youth 
Theatre ' s award- winning 



production of The Heart of a 
Dog, a Soviet political satire 
from the 1920s. The 
production went on to run in 
Edinburgh and London as 
well. When the London run 
conflicted with her entrance 
examinations for Oxford, 
Lucy made the daring 
decision to miss them and 
allow her application to be 
judged only on her interview 
and her A-level exam results. 



She was admitted to Oxford. 
As for ten-year-old Tim, 
Hawking said, 'Of all my 
children, he is probably the 
one most like me.' 2 He and 
Tim enjoyed playing games. 
Hawking usually won at 
chess, Tim at Monopoly. 'So 
we're both quite good at 
something,' proclaimed Tim.- 
In 1988 the American 
photographer Stephen 
Shames had taken pictures of 



them engaged in an 
impromptu game of hide-and- 
seek. Tim excelled at that. He 
could tell when his father was 
getting near by the hum of the 
wheelchair motor. 

Lucy told ABC's 20/20 
that she and her father 'get on 
quite well', though both are 
stubborn. 'I've had lots of 
arguments with him actually, 
I must admit, with neither of 
us willing to give ground. I 



think a lot of people don't 
realize just how stubborn he 
is. Once he gets an idea in his 
head, he will follow it 
through no matter what the 
consequences are. He doesn't 
let a thing drop ... He will do 
what he wants to do at any 
cost to anybody else.'- This 
sounds harsh, but when I 
spoke with Lucy, it was very 
clear she's enormously fond 
of her father and respects his 



opinions. In the ABC 
interview, she said that she 
thinks he has to be stubborn 
in his situation. It's a 
necessary mode of survival 
for him. His strength of will 
keeps him working day in, 
day out, grinning and 
delivering funny one-liners 
and ignoring a grim physical 
situation. If it also 
occasionally makes him 
appear spoiled and self- 



centred, it seems entirely 
reasonable to forgive him. 
About his health and the fear 
of his dying, Lucy said, ' I 
always think, "Oh he's going 
to be all right", because he's 
always pulled through 
everything that's happened to 
him. You can't help worrying 
about someone who's so frail. 
I get quite worried when he 
goes away.'- Lucy had 
learned to cope with such 



fears early. Her mother had 
tried to explain to her what 
ALS was when Lucy was a 
child. Then, Lucy had cried, 
certain that 'he was going to 
die the next day'.- 

In the academic world 
physicists continued to 
express tremendous respect 
for Hawking but were a little 
nonplussed by all the media 
hype. It didn't take higher 
maths to multiply book sales 



figures in the millions and 
find they amounted to more 
than Lucy's school fees. 
There was an occasional hint 
of sour grapes, a half- 
suppressed mutter of 'His 
work's no different from a lot 
of other physicists'; it's just 
that his condition makes him 
interesting.' One colleague 
commented that 'in a list of 
the twelve best theoretical 
physicists this century [the 



twentieth], Steve would be 
nowhere near'. 2 That was 
arguably true, considering the 
astounding list of physicists 
who lived in the twentieth 
century, and Hawking would 
have agreed, though the 
'nowhere near' was perhaps a 
bit harsh. But there was 
surprisingly little 
disparagement. He could 
more than hold his own in 
any contemporary company, 



and everybody knew it. 
Moreover, his colleagues 
enjoyed him. Sidney 
Coleman of Harvard, who 
rivalled Hawking not only as 
a physicist but also as a 
classroom comedian, was 
pleased that Hawking' s 
celebrity brought him more 
and more often to America, 
and frequently to New 
England. Other physicists 
who were sometimes unfairly 



eclipsed by Hawking did not 
blame him personally. 

Nevertheless, it wasn't 
unreasonable to suggest that 



would never have made him 
the celebrity he was or sold 
millions of books. Were those 
correct who said he'd 
exploited his pathetic 
condition and ridden his 
wheelchair to fame and 



Hawking 's 
accomplishments 



scientific 
alone 



fortune? The truth is, 
although Hawking would 
almost certainly prefer it 
otherwise, most of the non- 
physics world probably 
appreciates him more for his 
spirit than for his scientific 
achievements. He's not the 
only person who's overcome 
staggering odds and 
maintained a positive attitude 
in adverse circumstances, but 
who else has done it with 



quite such brilliant success 
and engaging style? 

For over a quarter of a 
century Stephen Hawking, 
perhaps with lapses we'll 
never know about, had kept 
up this spirit of optimism and 
determination for his own 
benefit. His survival and 
success depended on his 
doing so. However, it was a 
responsibility only to himself 
and to his family. In the late 



1980s, it became a 
responsibility to millions all 
over the world for whom he 
was an inspiration. Many, not 
only the disabled, expected 
him and his wife to go on 
proving that in spite of 
tragedy, life and people could 
still be absolutely splendid. 
We shouldn't be surprised if 
Hawking was leery about 
having that larger 
responsibility thrust on him. 



He was, he said, no more than 
simply human. Hawking 
would later comment that he 
did not see himself as being 
tragic and romantic, 
something like 6 a perfect soul 
living in a flawed body. I am 
proud of my intelligence, but 
I have had to accept that the 
disability is also a part of 
me.' And for disabled people 
Hawking had become a 
superb role model. 



Nevertheless, the disparity 
between what he'd achieved 
and what most could expect 
was sometimes discouraging. 
In most things except his 
illness Hawking has been 
outrageously lucky. 

Jane Hawking pointed out 
that if her husband were an 
obscure physics teacher, she 
couldn't have convinced a 
foundation to donate over 
fifty thousand pounds a year 



for nurses. There would be no 
computer program. He would 
be sitting day after pointless 
day in a nursing facility, 
away from his home and 
family, mute, isolated and 
wasted. Her bitterness about 
the way the National Health 
Service failed them led her to 
campaign for those with 
similar problems, trying to 
get the NHS to provide 
money for home nursing 



rather than tear apart families. 
The Hawking image 
encouraged universities to set 
up dormitories equipped for 
students needing round-the- 
clock nurses in order to attend 
classes. An abstract glass 
mini- sculpture sits on a filing 
cabinet in Hawking 's office, a 
gift from 'Hawking House', a 
dormitory at the University of 
Bristol. Cambridge built a 
similar facility. 



Whatever the effect on 
the rest of the world, in 1989 
Stephen Hawking had 'made 
it', against stupendous odds. 
The Queen named him a 
Companion of Honour, 
making him a member of an 
Order that consists of the 
Queen herself and not more 
than sixty-five other 
members. It is one of the 
highest honours she can 
bestow. The University of 



Cambridge did what it rarely 
does and gave one of its own 
faculty an honorary doctorate. 
Hawking received his degree 
from Prince Philip, chancellor 
of the university, and joined 
in the pageantry, going to and 
from the Senate House to the 
accompaniment of the choirs 
of King's College and St 
John's College and the 
Cambridge University Brass 
Ensemble. 'This year has 



been the crowning glory of all 
Stephen's achievements,' 
Jane Hawking said. ' I think 
he is very happy about it.'- 
He loved doing the work he 
did. ' I have a beautiful 
family, I am successful in my 
work, and I have written a 
bestseller. One really can't 
ask for more,' he said.- He'd 
earned this fame, and he was 
enjoying it. For someone 
who'd thought at the age of 



twenty-one that he had no 
reason to go on living, it was 
heady stuff indeed, a 
delicious joke on fate. 

But fate had its jokes too. 
There was an obvious down 
side to the overwhelming 
success of his book. Less 
time for his scientific work. 
Too many 'extracurricular 
activities', his students 
lamented. Too many visitors, 
but he seldom turned them 



away. Too many invitations, 
but he seemed incapable of 
refusing them. Too much 
travelling, but he scheduled 
more and more of it. Too 
much mail. He had answered 
the first few letters about A 
Brief History of Time 
personally, but that had 
almost immediately become 
impossible. His graduate 
assistant and his secretary 
took on major responsibility 



for answering his mail. 

Notoriety was not all fun. 
'It obviously helps me to get 
things done and it enables me 
to help other disabled 
people,' Hawking told a 
journalist. 'It also means I 
can't go anywhere incognito 
in the world. Wherever I go, 
people recognize me and 
come up to say how they 
enjoyed the book and can 
they have a photograph with 



me. It is gratifying that they 
are so enthusiastic, but there 
are times that I would like to 
be private.'- He came up 
with a solution, programming 
his voice synthesizer to say, 
'People often mistake me for 
that man.' Or, 'I am often 
mistaken for Stephen 
Hawking.' No one was 
fooled. 

As Hawking juggled his 
increasingly unmanageable 



schedule, colleagues began to 
worry that he would neglect 
his science. However, 
Hawking 's scientific work 
did continue. He tied up one 
small loose end when he was 
once again visiting Caltech in 
June 1990. The evidence 
having to do with Cygnus X- 
1 that had emerged during the 
sixteen years since he and 
Thorne had made their bet 
gave a 95 per cent certainty 



that Cygnus X-l is a black 
hole. It was time, Hawking 
decided, to settle with 
Thorne. When Thorne was 
away in Moscow, Hawking, 
with help from 'accessories to 
the crime', broke into his 
office where the framed bet 
was lodged and wrote a note 
on it conceding the bet. 
Stephen signed the note with 
his thumbprint. 

While Hawking travelled 



the globe as a celebrity in the 
late 1980s, in his head he 
travelled distances that make 
these journeys seem paltry by 
comparison. John Wheeler 
had earlier (in 1956) 
introduced the idea of 
' quantum wormholes ' . 

Hawking was now attempting 
adventures through these 
wormholes into even more 
exotic climes, into 'baby 
universes'. Let's stand with 



him outside space and time, 
to get a better view. 

A New Look at the 
Cosmic Balloon 

Hawking asks us to imagine 
an enormous balloon, 
inflating rapidly. The balloon 
is our universe. Dots on the 
surface are stars and galaxies. 
The dots cause dimples and 
puckers in the surface. As 



Einstein predicted, the 
presence of matter and/or 
energy causes a warping of 
spacetime. 

When we look at the 
cosmic balloon through a not- 
very-powerful microscope, 
the surface, regardless of the 
puckers, looks relatively 
smooth. Looking through a 
much more powerful 
microscope, we find it isn't 
smooth after all. The surface 



seems to be vibrating 
furiously, creating a blur, a 
fuzziness ( see Figure 10.9 ). 

We've seen such 
fuzziness before. The 
uncertainty principle causes 
the universe to be a very 
fuzzy affair at the quantum 
level. It's never possible to 
know precisely both the 
position and the momentum 
of a particle at the same time. 
One way to picture this 



quantum uncertainty is by 
imagining that each particle 
jitters in a sort of random 
microscopic vibration. The 
closer we try to look, the 
more violently it jitters. 
Scrutinize the quantum level 
with the greatest possible 
care, and we at best are able 
to say only that a particle has 
this probability of being here 
or that probability of 
moving like that. The surface 



of the cosmic balloon is 
unpredictable in a similar 
way. Under high enough 
magnification the quantum 
fluctuation becomes so 
incredibly chaotic that we can 
say there's a probability for it 
to be doing - anything. 

What did Stephen 
Hawking think this 'anything' 
might be? In the late 1980s he 
was pondering the probability 
that the cosmic balloon will 



develop a little bulge in it. 
More familiar balloons, the 
ones at parties, do that if one 
point on the surface is weak. 
Usually party balloons burst 
immediately when that 
happens, but on rare 
occasions a miniature balloon 
bulges out of the surface. If 
you could see this happening 
to our cosmic balloon, you 
would be witnessing the birth 
of a 'baby universe'. 



It sounds spectacular: the 
birth of a universe. Will we 
ever witness such an event? 
No, first because it happens 
in imaginary time, discussed 
in Chapter 10 . not 'real' time. 
Another reason we won't see 
it, said Hawking, is that if 
anything can truly be said to 
start small, it's a universe. 
The most probable size for 
the connection between our 
universe and the new baby - 



the umbilical cord, if you will 
is only about 10" 33 
centimetres across. To write 
that fraction you use 1 as the 
numerator and 1 followed by 
thirty-three zeros for the 
denominator. That's small! 
The opening - the wormhole, 
as it's called - is like a tiny 
black hole, flickering into 
existence and then vanishing 
after an interval too short to 
imagine. We've spoken of 



something else with an 
extremely short life span: in 
Chapter 6 . when we discussed 
Hawking radiation, we saw 
that you can think of 
fluctuations in an energy field 
as pairs of very short-lived 
particles. Wormholes 
similarly are a way of 
thinking about fluctuations in 
the fabric of spacetime: the 
surface of the cosmic balloon. 



Figure 12.1. Wormholes and baby 
universes 



Hawking' s suggestion 
was that the baby universe 
attached to this umbilical 
cord may not be short-lived, 
and small beginnings don't 
always continue small. He 
was thinking that eventually 
the new universe might 
expand to become something 
like our present universe, 



extending billions of light- 
years. Like our universe, but 
empty? Not at all. 'Matter,' 
Hawking pointed out, 'can be 
created in any size universe 
out of gravitational energy. '— 
The result might later be 
galaxies, stars, planets and, 
perhaps, life. 

Are there many baby and 
grown-up universes? Do they 
branch off everywhere? Right 
inside the kitchen sink? 



Inside your body? Hawking 
said yes, it may be that new 
universes are constantly 
coming into existence all 
around us, even from points 
inside us, completely 
undetectable to our senses. 

Perhaps you're wondering 
whether our universe began 
as a bulge from the side of 
another. It's possible, 
declared Hawking. Our 
universe may be part of an 



infinite labyrinth of 
universes, branching off and 
joining one another like a 
never-ending honeycomb, 
involving not only a lot of 
baby universes but adult 
universes as well. Two 
universes could develop 
wormhole connections in 
more than one spot. 
Wormholes might link parts 
of our own universe with 
other parts of it, or with other 



times ( Figure 12.1 ). 



Life in the Quantum 

Sieve 

Let's stretch our imaginations 
and look at all of this from 
the point of view of an 
electron. If there are 
quadrillions of wormholes 
flickering in and out of 
existence at every point in the 
universe, an electron is facing 



something like an enormous, 
furiously boiling pot of thick 
porridge. Moving across it is 
about as tricky as travelling 
across a giant, continuously 
changing sieve. An electron 
trying to move in a straight 
line in such an environment is 
almost certain to encounter a 
wormhole, fall in, and go 
shooting off into another 
universe. That sounds 
suspiciously as though matter 



will be disappearing from our 
universe, which isn't allowed. 
However, according to this 
theory, there is no danger of 
such a loss. An identical 
electron comes back the other 
way and pops into our 
universe. 

Wouldn't we notice this 
substitution of electrons? We 
won't see it that way. To us 
this event will look like one 
electron moving in a straight 



line. Hawking was thinking 
that the presence of 
wormholes, however, will 
make all electrons move as 
though they have a higher 
mass than they would if there 
were no wormholes. 
Therefore, if we're to try to 
predict particle masses with 
any theory, it's important to 
know whether or not there 
really are such things as 
wormholes. 



The theory said that if an 
electron falls into a wormhole 
accompanied by a photon, it 
won't appear to be anything 
out of the ordinary. We will 
observe only the normal 
exchange of a messenger 
particle in an electromagnetic 
interaction, in which one 
electron emits a photon and 
another absorbs it. Hawking 
was suggesting that perhaps 
all particle masses and all 



particle interactions - the 
ceaseless activity of the four 
forces, all over the universe - 
can be explained as this going 
into and out of wormholes. 

You would be right to 
wonder, at this point, how 
particles could possibly pass 
through wormholes. 
Wormholes would be much 
smaller than even the smallest 
particles we know. As with 
Hawking radiation, what is 



impossible in any way we try 
to picture it is possible in 
quantum mechanics. 

When Hawking 
calculated the effect of 
wormholes on the masses of 
particles such as electrons, his 
calculations at first suggested 
that the masses would be 
much larger than we actually 
observe for these particles. 
He and other researchers later 
managed to come up with 



more reasonable numbers. 
However, at the end of the 
1980s Hawking was 
expressing doubts whether 
wormhole theory can predict 
the masses of particles for our 
universe or any other. As we 
saw in Chapter 2 . when 
something must be measured 
directly and cannot be 
predicted by the theory, that's 
called an arbitrary element. 
The masses of particles and 



the strengths of the forces are, 
in every theory anyone has 
come up with so far, just such 
arbitrary elements. Wormhole 
theory may not make them 
any less arbitrary, but it might 
explain how they happen to 
be arbitrary. Hawking was 
thinking that the masses of 
particles and other 
fundamental numbers in 
nature may turn out to be 
'quantum variables'. That 



means they may be uncertain, 
like the paths of particles or 
what happens on the surface 
of the cosmic balloon. These 
numbers would be fixed at 
random at the moment of 
creation in each universe. A 
throw of the dice, so to speak, 
and then that's settled for that 
particular universe - but no 
way to know from a theory 
how the dice will fall, or 
perhaps even to say that one 



way is definitely more 
probable than another. 
Hawking was not sure this 
was the case in wormhole 
theory. However, the idea 
that fundamental numbers in 
nature - maybe even the 
'laws of nature' - might not 
be fundamental to the totality 
of universes, but different for 
different universes, was 
something that he would 
return to in another context 



later. 



A Severely Warped 
Universe 

'It is a great mystery why 
quantum fluctuations do not 
warp spacetime into a tiny 
ball,' says Hawking.- Recall 
that this is one of the enigmas 
that theorists must solve in 
the quest for the Theory of 
Everything. 



Physicists refer to this 
problem of the energy in the 
(so-called) vacuum as the 
cosmological constant 
problem. You'll remember 
that Einstein theorized about 
something called the 
cosmological constant, which 
would balance gravity and 
prevent the universe from 
changing in size. He later 
called it 'the greatest blunder 
of my life'. The term has 



come to have a related but 
slightly different meaning. 
The cosmological constant, 
as scientists now use the 
term, is a number which tells 
us how densely this energy in 
the vacuum is packed: the 
energy density of the vacuum. 
Common sense says there 
shouldn't be any energy there 
at all, but, as we've seen, the 
uncertainty principle shows 
that 'empty' space isn't 



empty. It seethes with energy. 
The cosmological constant 
(the energy density of the 
vacuum) ought to be 
enormous, and general 
relativity theory tells us this 
mass/energy should be 
curling up the universe. 

However, regardless of 
what the uncertainty principle 
and theory of general 
relativity indicate, we don't 
have a curled-up universe. 



Quite the contrary, at the time 
when Hawking was 
developing his wormhole 
theory, the value (the 
number) of the cosmological 
constant had been long 
thought, and observed, to be 
near zero. We find this out by 
observing the rate at which 
galaxies are moving away 
from one another, and from 
the fact of our own existence. 
'A large cosmological 



constant either positive or 
negative would make the 
universe unsuitable for the 
development of life,' 
Hawking points out.- The 
value of the cosmological 
constant is one of the 
examples of the 'fine-tuning' 
we saw in Chapter 9 . As we 
shall see, Einstein was too 
quick to call it a 'blunder'. 
But no one knew that in the 
early 1990s. 



How can the 

cosmological constant 
possibly be so small, as we 
observe, when theory tells us 
it should be enormous? 
Recall once again the particle 
pairs in Hawking radiation. In 
supergravity, the theory 
Hawking spoke of in his 
Lucasian lecture, pairs of 
fermions (matter particles) in 
the vacuum give negative 
energy and balance the 



positive energy of pairs of 
bosons (messengers). This 
may indeed be the 
explanation, or at least part of 
it, but it's a complicated 
matter. For one thing, these 
particles don't only interact 
with gravity. However, even 
if we do have a lot of 
positives and negatives 
cancelling one another out, 
for all of these to cancel out 
to zero is a little too much to 



swallow. As Sidney Coleman, 
who shared Hawking 's 
enthusiasm for wormholes, 
puts it: 'Zero is a suspicious 
number. Imagine that over a 
ten-year period you spend 
millions of dollars without 
looking at your salary, and 
when you finally compare 
what you spent with what you 
earned, they balance out to 
the penny.'— For the 
cosmological constant to 



balance out to zero is even 
less likely. 

Could wormholes solve 
the mystery? Hawking was 
thinking that wormholes 
branching off at every point 
make the cosmological 
constant, the energy density 
of the vacuum, a 'quantum 
variable' like the masses of 
particles. It can have any 
value. What's the probability 
of its being near zero? 



Imagine the birth of a 
universe as a 'baby' 
branching off from an 
existing universe. Wormhole 
theory says there are plenty of 
universes some more 

enormous than ours is today, 
others unimaginably smaller 
than an atom, and all sizes in 
between. The infant universe 
must copy its cosmological 
constant value from one of 
these other universes through 



a wormhole - 'inherit' it, you 
might say. It isn't important 
to a human infant whether it 
inherits a talent for music; it 
becomes important only when 
the infant grows larger. It 
isn't important to a baby 
universe whether it 'inherits' 
a cosmological constant value 
near zero. Its cosmological 
constant value won't even be 
measurable until it's quite a 
bit more grown-up. However, 



with all those assorted sizes 
of universes around, the 
infant is far more likely to 
inherit its cosmological 
constant value through 
wormhole attachments with 
large, cooler universes of the 
sort only possible when all 
those positives and negatives 
in the vacuum cancel out to 
zero. Coleman studied the 
probability of a universe (in 
wormhole theory) being a 



universe where the 
cosmological constant is near 
zero: our kind of universe. He 
found that any other sort of 
universe would be highly 
unlikely. 

Wormholes and the 
Theory of Everything 

Wormholes and baby 
universes fired the 
imaginations of many 



physicists. They began 
responding, disputing this and 
that, and offering alternative 
versions. That's always a 
good sign. 'The field of baby 
universes is in its infancy,' 
quipped Hawking, 'but 
growing fast. '— Could 
wormholes and baby 
universes contribute to the 
search for a complete theory 
of the universe? 

First of all, we've seen 



that the theory seemed to 
offer a new way of looking at 
the problem of the 
cosmological constant, the 
sticky question of the energy 
density in the vacuum, which 
ought to be shrinking the 
universe but isn't. Did 
Hawking think wormholes 
are the theory that will solve 
this inconsistency between 
general relativity and 
quantum mechanics? 'I would 



not go so far as that,' 
Hawking said. 'There is no 
fundamental inconsistency, 
but there are technical 
problems which wormholes 
don't help. 

Second, wormhole theory 
was a theory that didn't break 
down if you followed it back 
to the 'beginning'. With 
Einstein's theories, if you 
follow things back to the Big 
Bang, you reach a singularity 



where the laws of physics as 
we know them break down. 
Hawking ' s no-boundary 
proposal showed that in 
imaginary time there would 
be no singularity. Wormhole 
theory suggested that in 
imaginary time our universe 
may have begun as a baby 
universe branching off from 
another universe. 

Third, wormhole theory 
linked quantum theory and 



relativity theory in a 
satisfying, geometric way, 
allowing us to think of 
quantum fluctuations, 
quantum wormholes and baby 
universes as not too different 
from the warping of 
spacetime and black holes on 
the astronomical level. The 
fundamental numbers in our 
universe, such as the masses 
and charges of particles and 
the cosmological constant, 



might be the result of the 
shape, the geometry of a 
labyrinth of interconnected 
universes. 

Other theories can't 
predict the masses and 
charges of particles. These 
are arbitrary elements in the 
theories. An alien who had 
never seen our universe 
couldn't take these theories 
and use them to calculate 
what these fundamental 



quantities are, without 
peeking at the 'real' universe. 
We've seen that there is 
argument about whether 
wormholes might give us a 
way of understanding and 
calculating these fundamental 
numbers, or whether 
wormholes make their 
prediction less likely with any 
theory. 

Theorists who work in the 
field of superstring theory, 



which says that the 
fundamental objects in the 
universe are not pointlike 
particles after all but tiny 
vibrating strings, were hoping 
their theory might eventually 
be able to predict particle 
masses and charges. Hawking 
was pessimistic. 'If this 
picture of baby universes is 
correct, our ability to predict 
these quantities will be 
reduced.'- If we knew how 



many universes there are out 
there and what their sizes are, 
it would be different, but we 
don't know that. We can't 
even see their joining on to or 
branching off our own. We 
can't get an accurate picture 
of the shape of it all. We 
know only that if universes 
do join on or branch off, this 
changes the apparent values 
of such quantities as particle 
masses and charges. We end 



up with a small but definite 
amount of uncertainty in the 
predicted values. 

Hawking meanwhile 
wasn't worrying overly much 
about whether work like this 
was leading him to the 
Theory of Everything. His 
strategy is to concentrate on 
areas he understands, 
chipping away at the problem 
of what happens and how 
things work when relativity 



and quantum mechanics are 
taken together. What he 
discovers about the universe 
in this way should hold true, 
he thinks, regardless of what 
the theory of everything turns 
out to be and who finds it. 
His picture should fit in as 
part of the larger, or more 
basic, picture. 



Saving History 

Science fiction buffs will be 



disappointed if we don't 
discuss the possibility that 
something larger than a 
particle can travel through a 
wormhole into another 
universe or into another part 
of our universe. There has 
been a lot of science fiction 
utilizing the idea. On the face 
of it this form of travel seems 
as though it ought to be 
feasible. 

Science fiction and 



scientific speculation joined 
hands when Kip Thorne and 
his graduate students studied 
the possibility at the request 
in 1985 of Carl Sagan. Sagan 
needed a way to get the 
heroine of his novel Contact 
to a very distant location in 
space in no time at all. The 
problem is that a wormhole 
large enough for you or me or 
Sagan 's heroine to get 
through would be 



dangerously unstable. Even 
so small a disturbance as our 
presence would destroy the 
wormhole, and us with it. 
Thorne eventually thought he 
had found the answer, a way 
to hold the throat of a 
wormhole open using exotic 
material with a negative 
energy density - possible 
perhaps for a civilization 
much more advanced than 
our own. Hawking' s reaction 



to Thome's suggestion was 
characteristically succinct: 
'You're wrong.' 'There is 
little politeness in our 
community when one of us 
believes the other is wrong,' 
commented Thome.— 

Hawking set out to back 
up his opinion, and the result 
was something that he called 
the 'chronology protection 
conjecture'. His objection 
was specifically to a 



wormhole that was a time 
machine. The 'conjecture' 
was that nature prevents the 
trajectory in spacetime that 
would allow one to travel 
back in time (a 'closed, time- 
like curve'). The time- 
machine wormhole would 
always explode when you 
tried to activate it, and that 
explosion, Hawking declared, 
would 'keep the universe safe 
for historians'. No one could 



travel back in time and 
change history. Thorne, in a 
paper written for Hawking 's 
sixtieth birthday in 2002, 
reminded his readers and 
listeners that the chronology 
protection conjecture was just 
that, a 'conjecture', 'because 
both he and I were working 
with the laws of physics in a 
domain where we are uneasy 
about whether they really are 
correct'.- Hawking had also 



argued that 'the best evidence 
we have that time travel is not 
possible, and never will be, is 
that we have not been 
invaded by hordes of tourists 
from the future',- but he also 
wryly speculated that it could 
be that our time in history has 
become such a notoriously 
unpleasant tourist destination 
that visitors from the future 
always avoid it. 

Kip Thorne called 



Hawking 's paper about the 
'chronology protection 
conjecture' a 'tour de force', 
which didn't of course 
necessarily mean he agreed 
with it. For Thome's sixtieth 
birthday, Hawking gave him 
a calculation of the quantum 
mechanical probability of 
success for a wormhole time 
machine. Hawking had not 
become any more optimistic. 
He came up with 1 part in 



10 60 21 

What about a smaller 
black hole? When primordial 
black holes evaporate, what 
happens to things that fell 
into them earlier? Wormhole 
theory suggested that they 
may not necessarily return to 
our universe as particles. The 
particles instead may slip off 
into a baby universe. The 
information paradox rears its 
ugly head! Of course, this 



baby universe might join on 
again to our region of space- 
time. Then it would look like 
another black hole, which 
formed and evaporated. 
Things falling into one black 
hole would emerge as 
particles from the other black 
hole, and vice versa. That's 
space travel of a sort - if you 
happen to be a particle - and 
no information would be lost. 
Could wormholes and 



baby universes offer a 
solution to the 'information 
paradox'? If anyone was 
raising his or her head 
hopefully, thinking that 
perhaps the universe also had 
a way of keeping itself safe 
from information loss, those 
hopes were not going to be 
encouraged by Hawking any 
time soon. 



PART III 
1990-2000 



13 



'Is the end in sight for 
theoretical physics?' 



THE BUILDING THAT housed the 

University of Cambridge 
Department of Applied 
Mathematics and Theoretical 
Physics from the middle of 



the twentieth century until 
2000 was a grimy behemoth 
of no architectural distinction 
whatsoever. One had to 
conclude that those who 
worked there happily had to 
be pretty much oblivious to 
their surroundings or just 
loved the old place for other 
than aesthetic reasons. 

The entrance was off 
Silver Street through a 
narrow alleyway, an asphalt 



car park and a red door. The 
interior of the building was 
institutional; the floor plan 
pieced together illogically. A 
corridor beyond a small 
reception area made an abrupt 
right turn past an ancient 
black metal lift, continued 
straight for a while, then bent 
and widened past letterboxes 
and overstuffed bulletin 
boards with lecture and 
seminar notices and some 



lewd graffiti, narrowed again 
abruptly, and ended at the 
door of a large common 
room. 

For decades, it was in this 
common room that the 
DAMTP gathered for tea 
every afternoon at four. For 
most of the day the room was 
deserted and dimly lighted. 
The colour scheme showed a 
preference for lime green - in 
vinyl armchairs grouped 



around low tables, woodwork 
and the lower halves of the 
pillars supporting the high 
ceiling. There was a table 
with stacks of scientific 
publications, a rogues' 
gallery of small photos of 
present students and faculty 
on one wall, and formal 
portraits of former Lucasian 
professors on another. At the 
far end of the room enormous 
windows provided a view of a 



blank wall across the alley 
and admitted little light. 

Hawking 's office and a 
number of others opened off 
this common room. On his 
door there was a small 
placard: 'quiet please, the 
boss is asleep'. Probably not 
true. Hawking spent long 
hours, over the years, 
working in that pleasant, 
high-ceilinged office with his 
computers, photos of his 



children, a few plants, a life- 
size picture of Marilyn 
Monroe on the door and 
always, after 1985, one of his 
nurses in attendance. His one 
oversized window overlooked 
the car park. 

Hawking 's day there 
usually began at 11 a.m. His 
secretary reviewed his 
schedule with him. In the late 
1980s, that became 
something of a joke. They 



seldom managed to follow it, 
and anyone who had an 
appointment with Hawking 
had to remain flexible. 

The day continued with 
the soft clicking of his hand- 
held pressure switch. Propped 
in his chair, Hawking 
watched the computer screen 
impassively and selected 
words to communicate with 
visitors and interviewers, 
consult colleagues, advise 



students, converse over the 
telephone, write lectures or 
answer correspondence. 
Sometimes you heard the soft 
hum of his wheelchair motor 
as he guided it by means of a 
joystick through the common 
room and corridors to other 
rooms in the building for 
meetings and seminars. A 
nurse went with him. At 
intervals the well-modulated 
computer voice requested his 



nurse to adjust his position in 
the chair or suction fluid that 
accumulates in his breathing 
passage. 

Hawking 's nursing staff 
in the late 1980s was large 
and competent and varied as 
to age and sex. They seemed 
indulgently fond of Hawking 
and devoted to the task of 
making him look nice, 
keeping his hair brushed, his 
glasses clean, his chin wiped 



of the saliva that runs from 
his mouth, and, as they put it, 
to 'getting him sorted out' 
many times a day. Hawking 
had no choice but to be 
totally dependent on others, 
but there was never any air of 
helplessness about him. On 
the contrary he was vigorous 
and decisive, unquestionably 
in charge of his life. His staff 
said that the strength of his 
personality made working for 



him and with him both 
rewarding and demanding. I 
was never aware of the 
unpleasant competition 
among the nurses that Jane 
Hawking would later write 
about. 

In the late eighties the 
mail had become an 
impossible burden for 
Hawking 's research assistant, 
his personal assistant Sue 
Masey and one of his nurses 



who now helped them. They 
were struggling valiantly to 
write thoughtful answers to 
letters, poems, videotapes 
from all over the world, many 
of which told moving stories 
and deserved a personal 
response. It was sad to have 
to resort increasingly to polite 
preprinted postcards, but it 
would have taken all 
Hawking 's waking hours to 
handle even a fraction of his 



mail. 

At 1 p.m., rain or shine, 
Hawking would propel his 
wheelchair with portable 
computer attached out into 
the narrow Cambridge streets, 
sometimes accompanied only 
by a nurse, sometimes by 
students, who trotted to keep 
up with him. It was a short 
journey through the heart of 
Cambridge, past the up- 
market shops in King's 



Parade, King's College 
Chapel and the Senate House, 
to Gonville and Caius, to 
lunch with other Fellows of 
his college. There a nurse 
arranged a bib around his 
shoulders and spooned food 
into his mouth. Eating was no 
deterrent to conversation for 
Hawking, whose finger 
moved continually on his 
hand-held device, choosing 
words to talk with those near 



him. 

After lunch there was the 
return journey to the 
DAMTP. By then Hawking 
was notorious on at least two 
continents for his hair-raising 
wheelchair driving. Students 
would bound ahead into 
traffic on King's Parade and 
Silver Street to stop cars, 
lorries and bicycles as he 
recklessly barrelled ahead 
assuming the right of way. 



Acquaintances feared he was 
more likely to be crushed by 
a lorry than die from ALS. 

At 4 p.m. Hawking would 
emerge again from behind his 
lime green door. Teatime was 
a ritual in the department, and 
the empty, cavernous room 
would become suddenly 
deafeningly noisy with voices 
and the clatter of teacups. 
Most of the assembled 
physicists and 



mathematicians dressed as 
though they were on a 
construction site. Someone 
has commented that 
Hawking 's 'relativity group' 
looked like a rock group on a 
bad day. Their talk wasn't 
small talk. It ranged among 
wormholes, Euclidean 
regions, scalar fields and 
black holes. Equations were 
scrawled on the low tables. 
Hawking 's wry wit set the 



tone in his corner of the 
room, but former students 
claim that a few remarks from 
him during tea were often 
more valuable than an hour's 
lecture by somebody else. 
Hawking had mastered the art 
of packing a lot into a few 
words. Reading over notes 
later, you realized how 
precisely he had chosen his 
words to say exactly what he 
meant. 



At four thirty the common 
room would empty as rapidly 
as it had filled, and all but 
one of the long, fluorescent 
lighting fixtures were 
switched off. Hawking would 
glide back into his office to 
work until seven. In the late 
afternoon his students found 
him more available to help 
them. 

On some evenings 
Hawking dined in college, or, 



in a specially equipped van 
bought with award money 
from the 1988 Israeli Wolf 
Prize in physics, he would be 
driven to a concert or the 
theatre. When there was a 
concert at Tim's school, he 
would go to hear Tim play 
the cello with the orchestra. 
Tim was a good cellist, 
following in the footsteps of 
his sister Lucy. On other 
evenings Hawking would 



work late in his office. 

It was on one of those late 
evenings, in December 1989, 
that I went in to talk with him 
about plans for writing my 
first book about him. We 
discussed black holes and I 
read him a paragraph I'd 
written to make sure I had it 
right. When I paused to 
complain that my writing 
sounded dull because my 
editor was opposed to any fun 



or humour in a book about 
science, Hawking said, 'It 
should be fun. Tell him I said 
so.' I was certain this would 
win the argument with my 
editor. After all, Hawking' s 
own book was flying off the 
shelves and had sold millions 
of copies. At one point, as I 
watched the words flit across 
the screen, I was startled that 
the message was 'Would you 
please pull me up a little 



higher in my chair?' 
Realizing after a moment of 
confusion that this wasn't 
meant for me, I glanced over 
at the young male nurse 
sitting near us. He came to 
life, picked up Hawking and 
set him down in a better 
position. 

By the end of my visit 
that evening we had sorted 
out plans. Hawking would tell 
his personal assistant to 



supply me with childhood 
and family photographs and 
with material he had written 
about his childhood and his 
disability that had never been 
published. In May or June, 
when I had completed the 
science sections of the book, 
he would go over those with 
me. 



The precipice gives 



way 

Life at the focus of as much 
attention and adulation as 
Hawking was receiving 
inevitably takes on an 
unnatural cast. It isn't easy to 
keep things in perspective, no 
matter how levelheaded and 
grown-up you are or how 
good a sense of humour you 
have about yourself. For a 
quarter of a century Hawking 
had been convincing people 



that he was not subhuman. 
He'd succeeded too well. 
He'd convinced them he was 
superhuman. He had never 
deliberately encouraged this 
idea. He said he refused to be 
treated as less or more than 
simply human. But critics 
pointed out that he'd actually 
done precious little to 
discourage the superhero 
image. To be fair, who would 
have? It was fun and it sold 



books. Besides, what good 
did it do to try to discourage 
it? When he made statements 
like 'I get embarrassed when 
people call it courage; I've 
just done the only thing open 
to me in the situation', 1 some 
took it as false modesty and 
others as one more example 
of heroism. 

Hawking began openly 
shouldering, more than 
previously, the responsibility 



of being a role model for 
disabled people. In a speech 
before an occupational 
science conference at the 
University of Southern 
California in June 1990 he 
sounded almost militant. 'It is 
very important that disabled 
children should be helped to 
blend with others of the same 
age. It determines their self- 
image. How can one feel a 
member of the human race if 



one is set apart from an early 
age? It is a form of 
apartheid.' He said he 
counted himself lucky that his 
disease struck him fairly late, 
after he'd spent his childhood 
with able-bodied friends, 
engaged in normal physical 
games. He praised the 
mechanical advances that 
have helped him. But he went 
on to say that although 'aids 
like wheelchairs and 



computers can play an 
important role in overcoming 
physical deficiencies, the 
right mental attitude is even 
more important. It is no use 
complaining about the 
public's attitude about the 
disabled. It is up to disabled 
people to change people's 
awareness in the same way 
that blacks and women have 
changed public perceptions. '- 
Even Hawking 's critics 



couldn't deny that he had 
gone further than almost 
anyone else in history 
towards changing that 
awareness. 

While Hawking ranged all 
over the world giving talks, 
receiving honours, holding 
press conferences, and 
enjoying the general 
adulation, more and more 
frequently accompanied by 
Elaine Mason, Cambridge 



friends watched their 
'resident supercelebrity' with 
indulgence and delight, but 
also with mounting concern. 
They begrudged him none of 
the fun, but they worried 
about him. Was he beginning 
to believe the 'master of the 
universe' image? Would 
celebrity crowd out his 
scientific work? Mixed with 
his natural stubbornness, was 
it making him a wilful prima 



donna? Would an exalted 
self-image affect his family? 
Would the marriage that had 
endured so much adversity be 
able to survive? The public 
likes to own its heroes. Could 
Stephen ever be just Stephen 
again? It seemed unlikely. 

Jane Hawking' s 

relationship with Jonathan 
Hellyer Jones was still known 
to only a handful of very 
discreet people and news of it 



had not reached the wider 
world or the media - an 
astounding achievement in a 
town and university 
community as small as 
Cambridge. However, Jane 
had sounded an ominous note 
in an interview in 1989: 'I 
started with great optimism. 
Stephen was then infected 
with that optimism. His 
determination has now rather 
outstripped mine. I cannot 



keep up with him. I do think 
he tends to overcompensate 
for his condition by doing 
absolutely everything that 
comes to his notice.'- That 
'everything' had grown out of 
all proportion. Jane felt it was 
a tremendous victory that he 
was able to live at home and 
have a fairly normal life. 
Stephen Hawking wanted 
much more. There were more 
doors open to him, more 



possibilities, than he had ever 
dreamed of or could ever 
hope to explore; more 
demands on his time than he 
could ever hope to meet. 

All these activities and 
the adulation and awards 
were distancing him from his 
family. Increasingly they 
were carving out lives of their 
own, separate from his. 
Robert and Lucy were 
actively trying to be 



independent and move out of 
his shadow. Jane rarely 
accompanied him in his 
travels and public 
appearances. She sought 
escape in her teaching and her 
garden and in books and 
music. Her voice lessons had 
borne fruit and she had 
become a valued member of a 
top-flight Cambridge choir, 
often singing soprano solos. 
There were other friends 



besides Jonathan who shared 
her religious faith. Her role in 
Stephen's life had changed. It 
was, she said, no longer to 
encourage a sick husband. It 
was 'simply to tell him that 
he's not God'.- 

For twenty-five years 
Stephen and Jane Hawking 
together seemed to nearly 
everyone to have handled 
adversity magnificently. 
Again and again Stephen had 



spoken of their relationship as 
the mainstay of his life and 
his success. The Master of the 
Universe television special in 
1989 ended with a picture of 
the two of them watching 
their sleeping child, Tim, and 
Hawking saying, 'One really 
can't ask for more.' The 
Hawkings' public image had 
continued to reaffirm that life 
on the edge of the precipice 
was, for all its problems, a 



beautiful life. 

In the spring of 1990 the 
precipice that had been 
weakening from within for 
several years crumbled in a 
way few people had ever 
expected it would. What had 
seemed to me a fairly 
smoothly humming operation 
on Silver Street when I talked 
with Hawking the previous 
December had become, when 
I visited again with my 



completed science chapters in 
the early summer of 1990, 
frenetic and unhappy. I spent 
a week conversing with 
Hawking and having him vet 
my chapters, aware that for 
some reason the mood in the 
department, especially among 
the staff and those faculty 
members closest to him, and 
with Hawking himself, was 
tense, on a knife edge. 

Finally, a mutual friend 



who knew Jane Hawking well 
cleared up the mystery. 
Stephen had told Jane that he 
was leaving her for Elaine 
Mason. Even with media 
attention bordering on 
paparazzi, the Hawkings had 
kept their secrets so well that 
I, who had been interviewing 
him and was writing a book 
about him, could hardly 
believe the news. It seemed a 
tragic end to what most had 



thought was a beautiful, 
heroic marriage. To stalwarts 
who had been closest to 
Hawking the break-up had 
been no surprise. A couple of 
his most trusted staff had 
resigned, unwilling to deal 
with the turmoil of his 
disintegrating marriage and 
his new relationship with 
Elaine. Sue Masey was 
struggling to keep things 
moving ahead on an even 



keel. 

The Hawkings separated 
just short of their twenty-fifth 
wedding anniversary. Except 
for a brief mention to the 
press that autumn that he had 
left his wife but did not rule 
out the possibility of a 
reconciliation, neither 
Stephen nor Jane Hawking 
made any public statement. It 
was symptomatic of the love 
and respect Hawking 's 



friends and colleagues have 
for him that in a town where 
gossip moves like wildfire the 
news was very slow in 
spreading. As it did, a 
widening circle of 
acquaintances in Cambridge 
and all over the world reacted 
to it as a tragedy. The 
disintegration of marriages 
was commonplace, but 
Hawking and the Hawking 
marriage had seemed so very 



un-commonplace. At first, 
opinion turned strongly 
against him for leaving the 
wife who had supported him 
so courageously. Not until 
Jane Hawking published her 
memoirs in the late 1990s did 
a more balanced picture 
emerge, and it finally became 
known that the marriage had, 
in truth, been troubled for 
years. 

Hawking moved out of 



the house on West Road, and 
he and Elaine took up 
residence in Pinehurst, an 
attractive, upmarket, rather 
secluded cluster of homes and 
flats not far away in Grange 
Road. In the early nineties 
Elaine sometimes 
skateboarded back to that 
home after delivering her 
boys to school. 

Hawking had relinquished 
one of the pillars he had 



always said supported his 
life: his family. Was another 
such pillar, his scientific 
work, also in danger of 
collapse? 

The Lucasian 
Lecture - Revisited 

Though some feared the 
personal turmoil in 
Hawking 's life would 
undermine his scientific 



work, he continued to express 
his devotion to his science. 
He said he was 'itching to get 
on with it'. Was it still 
possible that he might be the 
physicist to fit it all together 
in the Theory of Everything, 
as the media had been 
prophesying? 

Hawking 's work wasn't 
in the newer mainstream of 
that effort: superstring theory. 
However, mainstreams in 



physics shift overnight, and a 
mind somewhat set apart may 
spot the connection that 
makes several streams 
converge into one complete 
theory. There were murmurs 
that by theoretical physics 
standards Hawking was 
already well over the hill. It's 
young people who usually 
make the great discoveries. A 
freshness of mind is required, 
a passionate, brash approach 



mixed with a certain amount 
of naivety. But Hawking 
certainly still had all of that. 
It would have been a 
profound mistake to rule him 
out on those grounds. 

Would he live long 
enough? His illness was still 
progressing but very slowly. 
Did he worry about dying 
before he finishes his work? 
In 1990 he replied to that 
question by saying that he 



never looks that far ahead. 
He's lived with the possibility 
of imminent death for so long 
that he isn't afraid of it. The 
kind of work he does is a 
joint effort, and there are 
plenty of other physicists to 
carry on with it. He's never 
claimed his presence is 
necessary for the Theory of 
Everything to be found. 'But 
I'm in no hurry to die,' he 
added. 'There's a lot I want to 



do first. '- 

In June 1990, ten years 
after his inaugural lecture as 
Lucasian Professor, I asked 
him how he would change his 
Lucasian lecture, were he to 
write it over again. Is the end 
in sight for theoretical 
physics? Yes, he said. But not 
by the end of the century. The 
most promising candidate to 
unify the forces and particles 
was no longer the N=8 



supergravity he'd spoken of 
then. It was superstrings, the 
theory that was explaining the 
fundamental objects of the 
universe as tiny, vibrating 
strings, and proposing that 
what we had been thinking of 
as particles are, instead, 
different ways a fundamental 
loop of string can vibrate. 
Superstrings would take a 
little longer to work out. Give 
it twenty or twenty- five years, 



he said. 

I asked him whether he 
believed his no-boundary 
proposal might turn out to 
answer the question, what are 
the boundary conditions of 
the universe? He answered 
yes. 

Hawking said he thought 
wormhole theory had 
important implications for a 
Theory of Everything. 
Because of wormholes it was 



probable that neither 
superstrings nor any other 
theory would be able to 
predict such fundamental 
numbers in the universe as 
particle charges and masses. 

And if somebody does 
find the Theory of 
Everything, what then? 
According to Hawking, doing 
physics after that would be 
like mountaineering after 
Mount Everest has been 



conquered. However, 
Hawking had also said in A 
Brief History of Time that for 
humanity as a whole it would 
be only the beginning, 
because, although a Theory of 
Everything would tell us how 
the universe works and why it 
is the way it is, it won't tell us 
why it exists at all. It would 
be just a set of rules and 
equations. He had wondered: 
'What is it that breathes fire 



into the equations and makes 
a universe for them to 
describe?' 'Why does the 
universe go to all the bother 
of existing?'- Those, he said, 
are questions that the usual 
scientific approach of coming 
up with mathematical models 
cannot answer. 

Hawking still longed to 
know the answers. 'If I knew 
that, then I would know 
everything important', 2 'then 



we would know the mind of 
God'.- That was where he had 
left it at the end of his book, 
but he had told a television 
interviewer: Tm not so 
optimistic about finding why 
the universe exists.'- He 
wasn't considering the 
question of whether we 
necessarily need to find the 
Theory of Everything in order 
to know the mind of God, 
whether there are, as Jane 



Hawking had suggested, 
other ways to know God 
besides in the laws of science. 

Stardom 

In 1990 Hawking received an 
honorary degree from 
Harvard University. Those 
who attended the ceremony 
and reception remember with 
fondness that Hawking' s 
fellow honoree Ella 
Fitzgerald sang especially for 



him at the reception. 

New non-academic faces 
were showing up outside 
Hawking 's door to read the 
little plaque, and were being 
made to wait just as though 
they were graduate students 
there for a supervision. It 
wasn't a local Cambridge or 
New York photographer, but 
Francis Giacobetti, 
photographer of the Pope and 
Federico Fellini, whose 



equipment and assistants 
crowded that side of the 
common room. Giacobetti 
believed the subjects of his 
portraits were best revealed 
by their hands, the irises of 
their eyes and in half-profile, 
and that was the way he was 
photographing them for an 
outdoor exhibition that would 
open in Paris and then travel 
around the world. Other 
subjects were Francis Crick, 



the novelist Garcia Marquez, 
the architect I. M. Pei. 

Nor was it just another 
interview by a television 
personality that pumped life 
to a new level of frenetic high 
energy in the common room 
and pushed physics 
discussions into the corners. 
Steven Spielberg agreed to 
produce a film version of A 
Brief History of Time, to be 
directed by the young Errol 



Morris. 

Morris was an inspired 
choice, with an unusual, 
intellectual, eclectic 
background. As a precocious 
ten-year-old he had given 
lectures on the solar system; 
as a teenager, played the cello 
and studied music with Nadia 
Boulanger at Fontainebleau; 
as an undergraduate, set 
records climbing in 
Yosemite; as a graduate 



student, rather unhappily 
done graduate work in 
science history at Princeton 
(studying with John Wheeler) 
and philosophy at Berkeley. 
None of this had appealed to 
Morris as his life's work, but, 
along the way, he picked up 
experience that would help 
him better understand others 
who did not fit an ordinary 
mould, such as Stephen 
Hawking.- 



Although the Berkeley 
faculty had rejected Morris's 
eccentric thesis proposal on 
the subject of the insanity 
plea, monster movies and 
murderers in Wisconsin 
prisons, his interest in the 
subject of 'true crime' 
continued after he began to 
make documentary films. 
Morris made contact with a 
man named Randal Adams, 
who was on death row 



awaiting execution for the 
murder of a Dallas 
policeman. Morris found the 
verdict questionable and took 
it upon himself to look into 
the case personally. He was 
not unqualified, having 
worked for several years as a 
private detective in New 
York when his film-making 
career was at a low ebb.- He 
documented his investigation 
of the Adams case on film, 



and solved it, winning 
Adams's release. The Thin 
Blue Line premiered in 1988 
to enormous critical acclaim 
and elevated Morris to the 
level of a major documentary 
film-maker. With good cause, 
he dubbed himself a 
' director/ detective ' .— 

It was this interesting, 
complicated, brilliant young 
man whom Spielberg brought 
together with Stephen 



Hawking for the filming of A 
Brief History of Time. One of 
the challenges Morris liked to 
set himself as a director was 
'how to extract a situation's 
truth without violating its 
mystery'- and it was with 
that question in mind that he 
approached the Hawking 
project. 

Spielberg's choice of 
Morris was partly made in the 
interest of solving a problem 



that emerged early on in the 
development of the film and 
threatened to doom the 
project. Hawking envisioned 
a film that would use all the 
state-of-the-art science fiction 
film-making technology and 
special effects available to 
Steven Spielberg and his 
colleagues to bring A Brief 
History of Time spectacularly 
to the screen. It seemed the 
project could not have fallen 



into better hands. He had no 
intention of allowing his 
personal life to be featured. 
The film-makers, however, 
argued that the film Hawking 
had in mind would never 
draw in the mass audience 
that both they and Hawking 
hoped to attract. The film 
must be biographical. 
Hawking took the matter up 
personally with Spielberg. 
One indomitable will had met 



another, but finally it was 
Spielberg who prevailed, by 
bringing Morris into the 
project and convincing 
Hawking that Morris could, 
as Hawking later wrote, 
'make a film that people 
would want to watch, but 
which doesn't lose sight of 
the purpose of the book'.- 
Morris saw Hawking' s 
courageous life with severe 
physical limitations and his 



bold scientific quest as 
'inseparable themes'.— He 
chose to let Hawking narrate 
the film himself, in his own 
synthesized voice, and 
repeatedly filmed him 
reflected in his computer 
screen. 

Among the most 
successful hallmarks of 
Morris's previous work had 
been his genius as an 
interviewer and his skilful use 



of talking heads, and 
Hawking, in an extraordinary 
capitulation, gave Morris 
permission to interview his 
family, friends and scientific 
colleagues on film. His 
permission, however, could 
not ensure Jane Hawking 's 
permission. She and their 
three children are not in the 
film except in photographs. 
Elaine Mason also refused to 
be interviewed, but Gordon 



Freedman, the executive 
producer, found she was 'a 
wonderful bouncing nurse' 
who did 'cartwheels on the 
soundstage'.- Stephen 
himself would not answer 
questions or make statements 
about his personal life in the 
film. However, Isobel 
Hawking, Stephen's mother, 
agreed to appear, and 
Hawking, at the premiere, 
thanked Morris for making 



his mother a film star. 

In an Afterword to the 
book published as a 
'companion' to the film, A 
Brief History of Time: A 
Reader's Companion, Gordon 
Freedman described the 'very 
strong working relationship' 
that developed between 
Hawking and Morris during 
the three years' filming first 
in a London studio and then 
in Cambridge, when Morris, 



disappointed at the way the 
film was turning out, started 
all over again. 'In the thick of 
the editing, Stephen Hawking 
and Errol Morris could be 
seen in the edit room for 
hours on end working toward 
a single vision for the film.'— 
A Brief History of Time 
premiered in New York and 
Los Angeles in August 1992. 
It won the 1992 Grand Jury 
Prize for Documentary 



Filmmaking and the 
Documentary Filmmaker's 
Trophy at the Sundance 
Festival, and the Filmmaker's 
Award from the National 
Society of Film Critics. Philip 
Gourevitch, writing in The 
New York Times Magazine, 
commented perceptively: 
'Morris's record of Hawking 
and the people who surround 
him creates the unexpected 
impression that he is a normal 



man who just happens to have 
the mind of a genius trapped 
in a devastated body. '— David 
Ansen in Newsweek praised 
the film as 'an elegant, 
inspirational and mysterious 
movie. Morris turns abstract 
ideas into haunting images, 
and keeps them spinning in 
the air with the finesse, and 
playfulness, of a master 
juggler. '— Richard Schickel 
in Time magazine spoke of its 



'splendid talking heads' and 
went on to say, 'that the 
metaphorical richness of this 
hypnotic movie has been 
accomplished by such simple 
means is a mark of its 
excellence'.— 

Morris himself was more 
than pleased with the final 
result. He called Hawking 'a 
symbol to millions of triumph 
over adversity and man's 
insignificance in the face of 



an implacable cosmos out 
there' and was satisfied that 
the film successfully 
conveyed that image. 
Compared with all previous 
work he had done, it was, 
Morris said, 'less cerebral and 
more moving', in spite of 
what might have seemed a 
difficult, esoteric subject, and 
even though in this film 
'everyone is smarter than 
me .— 



In spite of the undeniable 
beauty of the film and its 
critical success, it never 
reached a mass audience. In 
fact, it was never marketed or 
released to theatres in a way 
that would have allowed it to 
do that. We shall never know 
what the result would have 
been if Hawking had won the 
argument rather than 
Spielberg. 

The world might have 



turned upside down when it 
came to Hawking 's personal 
life: Elaine had become 
hugely important to him; he 
had become a film star; but, 
with all that, when I visited 
him again a couple of years 
later in the office and 
common room in Silver 
Street, it was as though time 
there had stood still. The 
description I'd written in 
1990 could have been written 



that day . . . the small clicking 
sounds, the words flitting 
back and forth, up and down, 
on the computer screen. The 
synthetic voice enunciated 
them politely. Students, 
nurses and colleagues passed 
in and out. At 4 p.m. the cups 
were lined up as precisely as 
a toy army on the counter in 
the common room. Former 
Lucasian Professors of 
Mathematics gazed down 



from their portraits on the 
intent little 'rock group on a 
bad day' as they sipped tea 
and talked their strange 
mathematical language. The 
figure in their midst was 
pitiful by all normal 
standards, like a guy on its 
way to the bonfire on Guy 
Fawkes Night. He wore a bib, 
and a nurse held his forehead 
and tipped his head forward 
so that he could drink his tea 



out of the cup she held under 
his chin. His hair was tousled, 
his mouth was slack, and his 
eyes were weary over the 
glasses that had slipped down 
his nose a little. But at a 
disrespectful quip from one 
of the students his face broke 
into a grin that would light 
the universe. 

My book in 1990 had 
ended with the words, 
'Whatever the future brings, 



in this unlikely, paradoxical 
story, we can hope it will be 
that grin an artist will capture 
someday in Hawking 's 
portrait, the portrait that will 
hang in the empty space still 
remaining on the common 
room wall beside his office 
door. Meanwhile the little 
plaque is a liar. The boss is 
not asleep.' 

That was more than 
twenty years ago. Hawking 



was forty-eight years old.

'Between film roles I 
enjoy solving physics 
problems' 



ANDREI LINDE, WORKING with 

alex vilenkin in the late 1980s 
and early 1990s, discovered 
that an inflationary universe 



has an amazing potential: in 
chaotic inflation theory, it can 
'self-reproduce'. The result is 
an enormous fractal 
arrangement of universes 
sprouting one out of another. 
Hawking 's 'baby universe' 
idea also proposed a 
multitude of other universes. 
Our own huge universe was 
suddenly looking small 
compared with a possible 
'multiverse'. 



Inflation Goes 
'Eternal' 

Imagine again one of those 
regions in the early universe 
that is inflating rapidly, while 
some of its neighbouring 
regions are not. Within that 
inflating region, Linde and 
Vilenkin thought, there would 
be sub-regions that would 
expand more rapidly than 
their parent region, while 



other sub-regions would not. 
Nor is that the end of the 
story. Sub-regions would 
beget sub- sub-regions, and so 
on and so forth. In other 
words each microscopic 
region that inflated would in 
turn be made up of 
microscopic sub-regions, 
some of which would inflate 
and be in turn made up of 
microscopic sub-sub-regions, 
and so on and so forth - an 



eternal inflationary universe 
scheme. 'Eternal inflation' 
would be a never-ending 
process of self-reproduction 
of the universe. As Linde 
described it, 'the universe is a 
huge, growing fractal. It 
consists of many inflating 
balls that produce new balls, 
which in turn produce more 
balls, ad infinitum.' 1 The 
universe we know and can 
observe is just one of these 



regions, or sub-regions, or 
sub-sub-regions. Cartoons 
portrayed Linde as a carnival 
balloon seller. 

Are there 'parallel 
universes' like ours? Not 
necessarily, though other 
universes something like ours 
can't be ruled out. Even 
though the total picture 
including what is beyond 'our 
universe' may be irregular 
and hugely complicated, in 



our universe the situation is 
smooth and relatively simple. 
Inflation in other regions or 
sub-regions might also have 
produced large smooth 
universes. The whole thing 
may, in fact, become divided 
into infinitely many 
exponentially large regions. 
However, when energy levels 
in those other large regions 
decrease to levels similar to 
those in our universe today, 



they will each have different 
laws of physics. Eternal 
inflation will produce an 
infinite variety of universes. 
In John Barrow's words, 'we 
find ourselves faced with the 
likelihood that ... we inhabit 
a single, simple patch of 
space and time in an elaborate 
cosmic quilt ... of huge 
diversity and historical 
complexity, most of which is 
totally inaccessible to us.'- 



And we don't find our patch 
as it is because it is the most 
likely kind of universe. It is 
not. 

Barrow used the words 
'historical complexity' 
advisedly, for if the whole 
picture is as eternal inflation 
describes, there is no reason 
to think that our own universe 
exists at or near the beginning 
of the eternal process. It 
might have originated as a 



sub-region of a sub-region of 
a sub-region - who knows 
how far we are down the 
line? In this model, our own 
universe has a beginning, but 
the big picture, the enormous 
fractal arrangement, perhaps 
need not have either a 
beginning or an end. Not 
everyone agrees that this 
picture stretches infinitely far 
into the past. Alan Guth, the 
founding father of inflation 



theory, working with Alex 
Vilenkin and Arvind Borde, 
thinks that the huge 'eternal' 
inflation scenario must have a 
past boundary, a beginning. 

If all this is taking place, 
shouldn't we be able to notice 
it? The answer is no. The 
inflation happens so rapidly 
that the regions and sub- 
regions and sub-sub-regions, 
etc., become immediately 
independent of one another. 



They move apart faster than 
the speed of light, becoming 
separate pocket universes. 

In Linde's words, 
'According to this scenario, 
we find ourselves inside a 
four- dimensional domain 
with our kind of physical 
laws, not because domains 
with different dimensionality 
and with alternate properties 
are impossible or improbable, 
but simply because our kind 



of life cannot exist in other 
domains.'- Among an infinite 
variety of universes, it is 
likely - perhaps inevitable - 
that one of them, at least, will 
be the kind where our sort of 
life can exist. The anthropic 
principle is alive and well, 
and not at all the cop-out it 
once seemed. 

If we can't see eternal 
inflation happening on our 
doorstep or anywhere else, is 



there any observational 
evidence - or even potentially 
possible evidence for 
eternal inflation? Hawking 
was going to show that this is 
not a hopelessly far-out 
question, though it might 
have seemed so when eternal 
inflation first appeared on the 
scene. 



Global celebrity 

As the last decade of the 



twentieth century got 
underway, Hawking kept up 
the exhausting level of 
international travel that had 
begun soon after the surgery 
that cost him his voice. Plane 
flights and hectic schedules 
were possible for him as long 
as he had indefatigable, 
intrepid nurses with him. 
Travel included more than 
giving lectures, taking part in 
conferences and being 



escorted by dignitaries around 
tourist sites. 

Trips to Japan, in 
particular, where Hawking 
went no fewer than seven 
times in the 1990s, seemed to 
produce unusual adventures. 
Joan Godwin, who was with 
him as a nurse on most of 
these eastern jaunts, recalls 
that on one visit Hawking 
expressed a strong desire to 
see the northern part of the 



country. His hosts warned 
him that this was an area 
where earthquakes were 
expected. They suggested a 
safer destination. Sendai. 
Sendai is, of course, where 
the devastating earthquake 
and tsunami and the 
subsequent deadly problems 
with nuclear reactors 
occurred in 2011, but Joan 
recalls that they had a 
delightful visit there. Once 



the subject of earthquakes 
had come up, however, Joan 
did confer with Hawking 
about what she should do if 
one occurred. 'Save yourself,' 
he said. 'Don't worry about 
me.' 

During another visit to 
Japan, an incident occurred 
that, though it represented no 
danger to Hawking 
physically, was perhaps a 
threat to his ego. On the 



bullet train platform he was 
surrounded as he often was 
by cameras and reporters 
clamouring for statements 
and pictures. Then, in the 
blink of an eye, they 
inexplicably turned their 
backs and sprinted off. 
Hawking was alone. 
Investigation revealed that a 
famous Sumo wrestler had 
alighted from a train on a 
nearby platform. Hawking 



was not the most important 
celebrity in the universe. 

Japan was also the setting 
for a story told by string 
theorist David Gross at 
Hawking ' s sixtieth-birthday 
party conference in 2002: 

When you travel with 
Stephen you get to 
meet all sorts of 
people you would 
never meet otherwise. 



We didn't get to meet 
the Emperor, which I 
regret, but we did get 
to meet somebody 
who I gather in Japan 
is even more popular 
and more famous, that 
is, the Green Tea 
Master, and we got to 
meet geisha girls, etc. 
But the most 
interesting experience 
was when Stephen 



insisted we all go to a 
karaoke bar. He 
actually got us to get 
up there and sing 
6 Yellow Submarine ' , 
which, if I were to try 
to reproduce, you 
would run screeching 
from the room. Every 
time the chorus came 
up Stephen would 
pipe in 'Yellow 
Submarine'; he 



probably still has a 
'Yellow Submarine' 
button that he can 
push!- 

Staying close to home 
was much less interesting. It 
was also no guarantee of 
safety. On 6 March 1991, the 
news spread quickly in 
Cambridge that Stephen 
Hawking had been knocked 
over by a taxi the evening 



before, crossing Grange 
Road, where he and Elaine 
were living in Pinehurst. It 
had been dark and raining, 
but the wheelchair had front 
and rear bicycle lights and 
should not have been difficult 
to see. His nurse screamed 
'Look out!', and the speeding 
car caught his wheelchair 
from behind as he was 
crossing. He was thrown out 
on to the road, landing with 



his legs over what remained 
of the destroyed chair. It 
would have been a serious 
accident even for someone in 
a state of perfect health and 
fitness. Nevertheless, he was 
out of hospital back in his 
office two days later, with a 
broken arm in a sling and 
stitched-up cuts on his head. 
His personal assistant Sue 
Masey, his graduate assistant, 
students and friends had spent 



those two days frantically 
bringing in a new wheelchair 
from another part of the 
country and finding the 
necessary parts to repair his 
computer system, making 
sure his equipment was 
restored to normal as rapidly 
as Hawking. 

In 1992, Stephen and 
Elaine built a large modern 
house not far from the centre 
of Cambridge. From there, 



Hawking took a new route to 
his office, through an 
attractive old passage known 
as Maltings Lane, emerging 
to skirt a pond and cross a 
low-lying, wild, green area of 
grass and trees and small 
bridges known as Sheep's 
Green. Then he crossed the 
River Cam where a weir 
separates the upper river from 
the part that runs through the 
Backs, and from there it was 



a straight shoot into Mill 
Lane and to his ramp at the 
DAMTP back entrance. 

Anyone familiar with that 
footpath through Sheep's 
Green might expect that the 
narrow bridges would have 
presented a problem. They 
are barely wide enough to 
allow bicycles to cross, if 
cyclists are sufficiently skilful 
to avoid scraping their hands 
on the wooden railings built 



at handle-bar height. 
Hawking in his wheelchair 
'threaded the needle' at 
speed, even in the dark. On 
one evening, making the trip 
home late with him, Joan 
Godwin stumbled off the 
ragged edge of the path and 
fell. Hawking, unaware she 
wasn't still behind him, 
blazed merrily ahead. When a 
kindly gentleman helped Joan 
up, announcing that he was 



an orthopaedic surgeon and 
hoped she wouldn't require 
his services, she asked him 
please to 'stop that 
wheelchair'. 

The Inflation of 
Wrinkles 

In April 1992, George Smoot, 
an astrophysicist at Lawrence 
Berkeley Laboratory and the 
University of California at 



Berkeley, and his colleagues 
at several other institutions, 
announced that data coming 
in from the Cosmic 
Background Explorer 
(COBE) satellite had revealed 
'ripples' in the CMBR. This 
was a hugely significant 
discovery. Those ripples were 
the first evidence of the 
elusive variations that 
astrophysicists and 
cosmologists had been 



looking for in vain since the 
1960s. These tiny differences 
in the topography of the 
universe when it was only an 
estimated 300,000 years old 
were evidence of a situation 
that would have given gravity 
a fingerhold and allowed 
matter to attract matter into 
larger and larger clumps, 
eventually forming planets, 
stars, galaxies and clusters of 
galaxies. The no-boundary 



proposal stood to gain 
credibility from Smoot's 
discovery. It had predicted 
both the overall smoothness 
of the universe and the 
deviations from that 
smoothness that COBE had 
found. 

Hawking recognized that 
the COBE findings might 
even be indirect observational 
evidence of Hawking 
radiation. As we have seen, 



according to inflation theory, 
long before the era in which 
the cosmic microwave 
background radiation 
originated - in fact, when the 
universe was far less than one 
second old - it went through 
a period of runaway inflation. 
Hawking pointed out that 
during that period the 
universe would have 
expanded so enormously and 
so rapidly that light travelling 



towards us from some 
faraway objects would never 
be able to reach us. It would 
have to travel at greater than 
the speed of light to do so. 
Hearing of some light being 
able to reach us, while other 
light can never reach us, 
suggests the event horizon of 
a black hole. Hawking 
proposed that there may 
indeed have been an event 
horizon in the early universe 



that was similar to the event 
horizon of a black hole, 
separating the region from 
which light reaches us from 
the region from which it 
doesn't. From that ancient 
horizon, there would be 
radiation just as there is from 
a black hole, and thermal 
radiation like this has a 
characteristic pattern of 
density fluctuations. In the 
case of the early universe 



event horizon, these density 
fluctuations would have 
expanded with the universe, 
but then become 'frozen in'. 
We would observe them 
today as a pattern of 
minuscule variations in 
temperature - the 'ripples' 
that Smoot found in the 
cosmic microwave 
background radiation. Those 
'ripples' did indeed turn out 
to have the characteristic 



pattern of density fluctuations 
from thermal radiation such 
as Hawking radiation. 

Star of Stage and 
Screen 

In the autumn of 1992, opera- 
lover Stephen Hawking found 
himself portrayed on the 
stage of the Metropolitan 
Opera in New York City, or 
rather as a figure suspended 



somewhat above it. The opera 
was not Wagner. It was The 
Voyage, a new work by Philip 
Glass, who had composed the 
score for the film A Briej 
History of Time. The Met 
commissioned The Voyage to 
celebrate the 500th 
anniversary of Columbus's 
journey to the new world, but 
Glass chose not to retell the 
story of Columbus. Instead he 
let Columbus symbolize the 



human longing to explore and 
discover.- In the opera's 
prologue, a wheelchair-bound 
figure, clearly meant to 
suggest Stephen Hawking, 
floated above the stage, 
intoning, 'The voyage lies 
where the vision lies.' A sky 
full of planets appeared as 
though he had conjured it, 
and he flew away. 

The following year, 
Hawking was more 



personally involved in one 
short escapade that remains a 
favourite memory not only 
for him but for many of the 
rest of us, travelling - in 
imagination - far more boldly 
into space than the real-life 
sub-orbital flight he still 
hopes to take. He was not, for 
a change, conveyed on the 
wings of theoretical physics. 

It began in the spring of 
1993, at a party celebrating 



the release of the home video 
version of the film A Brief 
History of Time.- Leonard 
Nimoy, who played the 
Vulcan Spock on Star Trek, 
was among the guests and 
had the honour of introducing 
Hawking. As People 
Magazine described it, 
'Vulcan's most famous son 
and Earth's most celebrated 
cosmologist instantly melded 
minds' 2 - an allusion that any 



faithful Star Trek viewer 
would appreciate. When 
Nimoy learned that Hawking 
was an avid fan of Star Trek 
and, like nearly every other 
fan, longed to be on the show, 
he contacted the executive 
producer Nick Berman. 
Berman lost no time 
arranging for a three-minute 
scene to be added at the 
beginning of one of the 
regular weekly episodes, 



titled 'Descent'. 

The scene was the 
'holodeck' of the Starship 
Enterprise - a part of the ship 
that uses holographic 
technology to turn the 
fantasies of crew members 
into 'reality'. This was the 
android Data's fantasy - a 
poker game with Einstein, 
Newton and Hawking. Not 
surprisingly, Hawking was 
the only one who played 



himself. He was sent the 
script well ahead of time and 
programmed his lines into his 
voice synthesizer. In the 
1990s and for most of the 
first decade of the twenty- 
first century, Hawking was 
still capable of a number of 
facial expressions, and these 
he put to good use playing his 
role. 'Everyone was 
astonished at how much 
mobility his face has. The 



vitality behind it is very 
evident,' commented the 
episode director Alex Singer; 
and John Neville, who played 
Isaac Newton, added, 'When 
you get that smile in response 
to something you've said, it's 
worth the whole day's pay, 
really.'- Brent Spiner, who as 
Data was the host of this 
remarkable poker game, 
summed it up: 'When Rick 
Berman and I are in the old 



folks' home sitting in rocking 
chairs, we're going to be 
talking about the Hawk.' 2 
Hawking also seemed to be 
getting his priorities right: 
'Between film roles,' he 
commented on the set, 'I 
enjoy solving physics 
problems.'— His one regret 
was that 'unfortunately there 
was a red alert, so I never 
collected my winnings' 
although he had 'beaten them 



all'.ii 

The cameo role on Star 
Trek brought Hawking back 
into the public limelight to a 
degree that almost exceeded 
the fame won him by A Brief 
History of Time and was an 
asset in publicizing his Black 
Holes and Baby Universes 
and Other Essays, which 
came out the same year, 
1993. There soon were other 
appearances in pop culture. 



The song 'Keep Talking' on 
Pink Floyd's The Division 
Bell album featured his 
computerized voice. 

Advocate and role 
model 

The Star Trek episode also 
brought him to the attention, 
far more than his books had, 
of young people with various 
forms and degrees of 



disability. A Time magazine 
article in September 1993 
described him speaking in 
Seattle for more than an hour 
to a rapt, 'completely 
focused' audience of 
teenagers in wheelchairs. - 
After the talk, they crowded 
around him, asking questions 
most of which had to do with 
the practicalities of living 
with disability and political 
issues pertaining to the 



disabled, rather than with 
science or the cosmos. 'As 
they wait for Hawking to tap 
out his answers, they can't 
stop grinning. Here's a 
famous scientist, a best- 
selling author, a Star Trek 
star - and he's disabled, just 
like they are.'— The truth of 
Hawking 's statement that his 
fame, while being a mixed 
blessing, 'enables me to help 
other disabled people \— was 



evident. 

He would help in other 
ways. In the summer of 1995, 
he lectured to a capacity 
crowd at London's Royal 
Albert Hall, no mean amount 
of crowd-drawing power for a 
venue seating 5,000. The 
proceeds went to an ALS 
charity. He helped to 
publicize an exhibit of 
technological aids for 
disabled people, called 



'Speak to Me', at London's 
Science Museum. His 
presence or sponsorship could 
assure a sellout crowd nearly 
anywhere in the world. A 
January 1993 article in 
Newsweek described the 
public and media frenzy at 
lectures in Berkeley, 
California, where many of the 
audience showed up more 
than three hours early to get 
seats.- As he rolled to centre 



stage, photographers jostled 
one another for good 
positions and there was a 
blizzard of flash bulbs. 
Harnessing that sort of 
excitement for the good of 
disabled people was well 
worth doing. 

Over a decade Hawking 
had become a master 
manipulator of his public . . . 
or was it just an accident that 
he always seemed to come up 



with attention-getting 
statements whenever public 
and media attention appeared 
to require a boost. As one of 
his personal assistants once 
commented to me, 'He isn't 
stupid, you know.' 
Whichever it was, it proved 
an advantage not only for 
himself but for advocates for 
the disabled and for science 
in general. 



A Challenge for the 
'Prime Directive' 

An uncharacteristically sour 
pronouncement at the 
Macworld Expo in Boston in 
August 1994 made the news 
all over the world: 'Maybe it 
says something about human 
nature that the only form of 
life we have created so far is 
purely destructive. We've 
created life in our own 



image.'- Hawking was 
talking about computer 
viruses. 

Are computer viruses a 
form of life? Hawking 
thought they should 'count as 
life' and, with those words, 
initiated an uproar. In a recent 
episode of Star Trek, Captain 
Picard, confronting a super- 
intelligent virus, had 
negotiated with it rather than 
destroy it, to avoid violating 



the Star Fleet 'prime 
directive' that forbids 
interfering in the internal 
development or social order 
of any alien society. 
Destruction of the virus, in 
this case, would have 
constituted such a violation. 
Clearly the writers of Star 
Trek agreed with Hawking. 
There were plenty of fans of 
both Star Trek and Hawking 
ready to join the debate, on 



one side or the other. 

' A living being usually 
has two elements,' Hawking 
argued. 'First, an internal set 
of instructions that tell it how 
to sustain and reproduce 
itself. Second, a mechanism 
to carry out the instructions.' 
Life as we know it is 
biological life, and these two 
elements are the genes and 
the metabolism. But 'it is 
worth emphasizing that there 



need be nothing biological 
about them'. A computer 
virus copies itself as it moves 
into different computers and 
infects linked systems. 
Though it does not have a 
metabolism in the usual 
sense, it uses the metabolism 
of its hosts, like a parasite. 
'Most forms of life, ourselves 
included, are parasites in that 
they feed off and depend for 
their survival on other forms 



of life.' 

Because in biology it is 
by no means a settled matter 
what is life and what is not, 
biologists asked to comment 
were unwilling to say that 
Hawking was wrong. 
Computer viruses do certainly 
fit some definitions of life. 

Hawking closed his 
speech with yet another 
startling suggestion for what 
'life' might include. Human 



life spans are too short for 
long-distance interstellar and 
intergalactic travel, even at 
the speed of light. However, 
the necessary longevity 
would not be difficult for 
mechanical spaceships that 
could land on distant planets, 
mine their resources and then 
produce new spaceships. The 
voyage could go on for ever. 
'These machines would be a 
new form of life based on 



mechanical and electronic 
components rather than 
macro molecules [like 
biological life],' said 
Hawking. A bleak prophecy! 

With everything else he 
was managing to fit into his 
schedule, Hawking found 
time in 1993 to co-edit a 
volume of technical papers on 
Euclidean quantum gravity 
with Gary Gibbons.— 
Hawking wrote or co-wrote 



sixteen of the thirty- seven 
papers himself. That same 
year he also published a 
collection of his own papers 
on black holes and the big 
bang.- 

Arrows of Time 

Another subject Hawking was 
lecturing on in his public 
lectures in the early 1990s 
was far less disturbing than 
viruses as a form of life. It 



was something that had 
intrigued him for many years: 
'arrows of time'. The increase 
of entropy (disorder) and the 
human perception of past and 
future seem to be linked with 
the expansion of the universe. 
Why should this be so? As a 
doctoral student he had 
considered writing his thesis 
on this mysterious topic but 
decided he wanted something 
'more definite and less airy- 



fairy'. Singularity theorems 
were 'a lot easier '.— 
However, when he and Jim 
Hartle were developing their 
no-boundary proposal, 
Hawking had recognized that 
this work had interesting 
implications for arrows of 
time. He returned to the 
subject in a paper he wrote in 
1985 and intended to work on 
it more at CERN that summer 
when he instead ended up so 



disastrously in hospital. 

In the early nineties, with 
an increasing demand for 
public lectures, Hawking 
found that this was indeed a 
topic that interested his non- 
expert audiences and that he 
could explain fairly simply 
and succinctly. It was also a 
subject that allowed him to 
show that eminent scientists 
are capable of changing their 
minds and admitting 



mistakes. 

With very few exceptions, 
the laws of science make no 
distinction between forward 
and backward directions of 
time. The laws are 
symmetrical with respect to 
time. You could make a film 
of most physical interactions 
and reverse the direction of 
the film and no one who saw 
it could say which way it 
ought to run. Strange, then, 



that this is not our experience 
at the level of the everyday 
world. We have a well- 
defined future and past. We 
nearly always can tell if a 
film is running backwards. It 
would be difficult to mistake 
one direction for another. 
How this 'symmetry- 
breaking' occurs is still one 
of the great mysteries, but we 
do know that in the universe 
as we experience it, our 



perception of the passage of 
time seems to be linked with 
the fact that, in any closed 
system, disorder (or entropy) 
always increases with time. 
The road from order to 
disorder is a one-way street. 
Broken pottery does not pull 
its scattered pieces together 
and hop back on to the shelf. 
Entropy, disorder, never 
decreases. 

There are three 'arrows of 



time': the 'thermodynamic 
arrow' (the direction in which 
disorder, or entropy, 
increases); the 
'psychological' or 
'subjective' arrow (the way 
human beings experience 
time passing); and the 
'cosmological arrow' (the 
direction of time in which the 
universe is expanding, not 
contracting). The question 
that interested Hawking was 



why these three arrows exist 
at all, why they are so well 
defined and why they point in 
the same direction. Disorder 
increases, and we experience 
the passage of time from past 
to future, while the universe 
expands. He suspected the 
answer lay in the no- 
boundary condition for the 
universe, with some help 
from the anthropic principle. 
The thermodynamic 



arrow (having to do with the 
increase of disorder or 
entropy) and the 

psychological arrow (our 
everyday perception of time) 
do point, always, in the same 
direction. It is common 
experience that as time moves 
forward, disorder, or entropy, 
increases. Hawking admitted 
that this is a tautology, 
concluding that 'entropy 
increases with time because 



we define the direction of 
time to be that in which 
entropy increases'- - but he 
was satisfied that the 
psychological arrow and the 
thermodynamic arrow are 
essentially the same arrow. 

Why then does it point in 
the same direction as the 
cosmological arrow of time, 
with the expansion of the 
universe? Must it? Enter the 
no-boundary proposal. Recall 



that in the classical theory of 
general relativity all physical 
laws break down at the Big 
Bang singularity. It is 
impossible to predict whether 
or not the beginning of time 
would have been orderly or a 
situation of complete disorder 
in which there was no 
possibility of disorder 
increasing. However, if 
Hawking 's and Hartle's no- 
boundary proposal is correct, 



the beginning was 'a regular, 
smooth point of spacetime 
and the universe would have 
begun its expansion in a very 
smooth and ordered state'.— 
As the universe expanded, the 
gradual development of all 
the structure we observe 
today - galaxy clusters, 
galaxies, star systems, stars, 
planets, you and me - 
represented a continuous, 
enormous increase in 



disorder, and this trend 
continues. Hence, in the 
universe as we know it, the 
thermodynamic arrow, the 
psychological arrow and the 
cosmological arrow all point 
in the same direction. 

But consider what might 
happen if Friedmann's first 
model of the universe is 
correct ( see Figure 6.1 ). the 
model in which the universe 
eventually stops expanding 



and begins to contract. When 
expansion changes to 
contraction, the cosmological 
arrow of time reverses 
direction. The big question 
was, would the 

thermodynamic and 
psychological arrows of time 
also reverse direction? Would 
disorder start to decrease! 
Hawking thought there were 
all sorts of interesting 
possibilities for science 



fiction writers here, but he 
also pointed out that it was 'a 
bit academic to worry about 
what would happen when the 
universe collapses again, as it 
will not start to contract for at 
least another ten thousand 
million years.'— 

Nevertheless, the no- 
boundary condition did seem 
to mean that disorder would 
decrease in the collapsing 
universe, and Hawking at first 



concluded that when the 
universe stopped expanding 
and started to collapse, not 
only the cosmological arrow 
but all three arrows would 
reverse direction and all three 
continue to point in the same 
direction as one another. 
Time would be reversed and 
people would live their lives 
backwards, 'youthening', as 
the magician Merlin did in T. 
H. White's Arthurian novel 



The Once and Future King. 
Broken teacups would 
reassemble. 

Don Page, by then in the 
physics faculty at 
Pennsylvania State 
University, begged to differ. 
In a paper that eventually 
appeared in the same issue of 
Physical Review as 
Hawking 's arrow of time 
paper, Page argued that the 
no-boundary condition did 



not mean that all three arrows 
would have to be reversed 
when the universe was in its 
contracting phase.- Raymond 
LaFlamme, one of Hawking 's 
students, found a more 
complicated model, and the 
three argued and sent 
calculations back and forth. 
Page, with more experience 
of working with Hawking, 
suggested to LaFlamme that 
it would be best not to tell 



Hawking their conclusion but 
first to lay out all their 
assumptions in such a way 
that Stephen would arrive at 
the same result without their 
having told him what it was.- 
They finally convinced their 
mentor that he had been 
wrong. Though the 
cosmological arrow of time 
would reverse when the 
universe stopped expanding 
and began to contract, the 



thermodynamic and 
psychological arrows would 
not. It was too late to change 
Hawking 's paper, but he was 
able to insert a note 
admitting, 'I think that Page 
may well be right in his 
suggestion.'- 

What, then, is the answer 
to the question, why do we 
observe the thermodynamic, 
psychological, and 
cosmological arrows pointing 



in the same direction? 
Because, even though we 
would not find ourselves 
'youthening', we could not 
survive in the universe when 
it is collapsing, when the 
cosmological arrow of time 
has reversed. At that distance 
in the future, the universe will 
be in a state of nearly total 
disorder, all the stars burned 
out, the protons and neutrons 
in them decayed into light 



particles and radiation. There 
will no longer be a strong 
thermodynamic arrow of time 
at all. We couldn't survive 
the death of our sun, but even 
if we could, we also require a 
strong thermodynamic arrow 
of time in order to exist. For 
one thing, human beings have 
to eat. Food is a relatively 
ordered form of energy. The 
heat into which our bodies 
convert food is more 



disordered. Hawking had 
concluded that the 
psychological and 
thermodynamic arrows of 
time are for all intents and 
purposes the same arrow, and 
if one fizzles out, so does the 
other. In the contracting 
phase of the universe there 
could be no intelligent life. 
The answer to the question of 
why we observe the 
thermodynamic, 



psychological and 
cosmological arrows pointing 
in the same direction is: 
because, if things were 
different, there would be no 
one around to ask those 
questions. If that sounds 
familiar, it is none other than 
the anthropic principle. As 
time (in all three senses) 
passed, Hawking was 
thinking less and less of the 
anthropic principle as a cop- 



out, ' a negation of all our 
hopes of understanding the 
underlying order of the 
universe', and increasingly 
regarding it as a powerful 
principle indeed. 

More Conjuring at 
the Event Horizon 

Hawking had suspected in 
1981 that Leonard Susskind 
was 'the only one in the room 



who fully appreciated the 
implications of what I had 
said', in Werner Erhard's 
attic. In the years since then, 
Susskind had never been able 
to leave the information 
paradox problem alone. 'Just 
about everything I have 
thought about since 1980 has 
in one way or another been a 
response to [Hawking 's] 
profoundly insightful 
question about the fate of 



information that falls into a 
black hole. While I firmly 
believe his answer was 
wrong, the question and his 
insistence on a convincing 
answer have forced us to 
rethink the foundations of 
physics.'- In 1993, referring 
back to work Hawking had 
done in the 1970s, Susskind 
came up with a new way of 
dealing with a contradiction 
that defied common sense at 



the event horizon of a black 
hole. 

It will come as no news to 
anyone who has read even the 
most rudimentary book about 
black holes that if someone 
(let us call her Miranda) falls 
into one, the experience for 
her will be radically different 
from what it appears to be 
from the vantage point of 
someone (let us call him 
Owen) who is watching from 



a spaceship at a distance 
outside the black hole. 
Einstein showed that if two 
people are moving rapidly 
relative to one other, each one 
sees the other's clock slow 
down and sees the other being 
flattened out in the direction 
of motion. Also a clock that is 
in the vicinity of a massive 
object (and a black hole is a 
very massive object) will run 
more slowly compared with 



one that is not. 

The upshot is that from 
the vantage point of distant 
observer Owen, Miranda as 
she falls towards the black 
hole seems to be falling more 
and more slowly with her 
body squashed to a thinner 
and thinner pancake. Finally, 
when Miranda reaches the 
event horizon, Owen sees her 
come to a stop. He never sees 
her fall through the horizon, 



in fact, never sees her quite 
get there. Meanwhile, 
Miranda's own experience is 
that she falls through the 
event horizon intact. From 
Owen's point of view, she is 
stuck and flattened; from 
Miranda's point of view, she 
is still falling. 

Susskind had set himself 
to find out how both could be 
true and pointed out that 
although he and you and I, 



who are neither falling in nor 
watching from a distance, can 
agree that both scenarios in 
our example have occurred, 
and be troubled by the 
contradiction, none of us is 
actually on the spot. Suppose 
instead that you and I are part 
of the action. This time I will 
be the observer at a distance. 
You fall into the black hole. 
The crux of the matter is that 
in a real-life playing out of 



this story, neither I, the 
observer at a distance, nor 
you, who fall into the black 
hole, ever observes or 
experiences the contradiction. 
And you who have 
experienced an uneventful 
fall through the event horizon 
are absolutely incapable of 
going back and comparing 
notes with me or of sending 
me a message. If I happen to 
fall in later (this possibility 



stumped Susskind for a 
while), you would still be so 
far ahead on the way to the 
singularity that I would never 
catch up. It would be 
impossible for either of us, 
ever, to know about the 
version of the story that 
contradicted our own. 

Susskind, and colleagues 
Larus Thorlacius and John 
Uglum, called this principle 
that neither observer ever 



sees a violation of the laws of 
nature 'horizon 
complementarity' . 

Take a moment to recall 
what 'complementarity' 
means. It is using two 
different, perhaps mutually 
exclusive descriptions in 
order to gain a better 
understanding than either 
description alone provides. 
Early in the twentieth century 
it was physicist Niels Bohr's 



way of addressing a problem 
in physics known as wave- 
particle duality. People 
experimenting with the way 
light propagates (the way it 
travels) found that it acts as 
though it were waves. The 
description of it as particles is 
ruled out. However, when 
they studied the way light 
interacts with matter, they 
found that it acts as though it 
must be particles. The model 



that describes it as waves is 
ruled out. By 1920 it was 
clear that light could be 
conceived of either in terms 
of waves or in terms of 
particles, but that neither 
model by itself could explain 
the experimental data, and 
this odd situation could not be 
resolved by saying that light 
is sometimes particles and 
sometimes waves, or that 
light is both particles and 



waves. The problem applies 
to matter as well as to 
radiation. Bohr wrote to 
Einstein in 1927, concluding 
that it was possible to live 
with what looked like a 
contradiction 'as long as we 
don't allow our intuitive 
feeling that matter and 
radiation must be either wave 
or particle to "lead us into 
temptation'" .— The 
descriptions were 



incompatible but both 
necessary, and both correct. 

The same could be said in 
the case of horizon 
complementarity. As 
Susskind summed it up, 'The 
paradox of information being 
at two places at the same time 
is apparent and yet a careful 
analysis shows that no real 
contradictions arise. But there 
is a weirdness to it,' he 
admits.- Gerard 't Hooft of 



Utrecht had in 1993 
introduced what he called 
'dimensional reduction'. 
Susskind rechristened it the 
'holographic principle'. 

Go back to thinking about 
Miranda falling towards the 
event horizon, as viewed by 
Owen, the distant observer in 
the spaceship. From the 
spaceship, because of time 
dilation, Miranda appeared to 
freeze and spread out at the 



event horizon. Susskind 
points out that, by the same 
token, Owen will also see 
everything else that originally 
went into the formation of the 
black hole, and everything 
that has fallen into it, likewise 
frozen at the horizon. 'The 
black hole consists of an 
immense junkyard of 
flattened matter at its 
horizon,' says Susskind. 

The 'holographic 



principle', then, is the idea 
that information is in some 
sense stored on the boundary 
of a system instead of inside 
it. Think of the holographic 
image on a credit card, where 
a three-dimensional image is 
stored on the two- 
dimensional surface of the 
card. Susskind elaborated on 
that idea to compare a black 
hole with a giant cosmic 
projector that takes a three- 



dimensional person and turns 
her into a two-dimensional 
surface on the event horizon. 
The bottom line was that all 
that information, stretched 
out on the edge of the black 
hole, is not destroyed. It is all 
there. Not lost. 

A very interesting 
suggestion about how this all 
happens came from string 
theory, in which, you will 
recall, particles do not look 



like points but rather like tiny 
loops of vibrating string. The 
way a loop of string vibrates 
determines which type of 
particle it is. First, think of a 
single string falling into a 
black hole. You are watching 
it from a spaceship at a 
distance. As it approaches the 
event horizon, its vibration 
appears to slow down. The 
string spreads, ending up with 
whatever information it 



carries smeared over the 
entire event horizon. As each 
string spreads out, it overlaps 
others, resulting in a dense 
tangle. Since everything is 
made of strings, everything 
that falls towards a black hole 
is smeared out like that. The 
resulting giant tangle of 
strings covering the surface 
of the black hole is able to 
hold the entire enormous 
amount of information that 



fell when the black hole 
formed and afterwards. Here, 
then, at the horizon, is 
everything that 'fell into the 
black hole'. As far as the 
observer at a distance is 
concerned, it didn't fall into 
the hole at all. It stopped at 
the horizon and was later 
radiated back into space. 

Susskind visited 
Cambridge in 1994 and 
looked upon it as a golden 



opportunity to talk with 
Hawking and convince him 
that horizon complementarity 
could solve the information 
paradox. Unfortunately 
Hawking was ill at the time 
and they were unable to 
connect. Finally, Hawking 
attended a lecture that 
Susskind delivered about 
black hole complementarity. 
Susskind remembers the 
occasion: 'This was the last 



chance for a confrontation 
with Stephen. The lecture 
room was full to capacity. 
Stephen arrived just as I was 
starting and sat in the back. 
Normally, he sits up front 
near the blackboard. He was 
not alone; his nurse and 
another assistant were in 
attendance, just in case he 
needed medical attention. It 
was obvious that he was 
having trouble, and about half 



way through the seminar, he 
left. That was it.'— Susskind's 
ideas would wait until early 
in the twenty-first century for 
someone to give them a 
rigorous mathematical 
treatment. 



15 



'I think we have a 
good chance of 
avoiding both 
Armageddon and a 
new Dark Age' 

in the spring of 1995, seven 



years after it first appeared, A 
Brief History of Time finally 
went into paperback. 
Normally this would happen 
for a book about a year after 
its initial publication, but 
because the hardcover 
continued to sell at such a 
phenomenal rate, Bantam had 
repeatedly put off that 
decision. An interviewer told 
Hawking that with 600,000 
copies sold in the UK, more 



than 8 million worldwide, and 
more than 235 weeks on the 
Times bestseller list, it was 
difficult to imagine there 
were still people who had 
waited seven years to learn 
the secrets of the universe, 
just so they could buy his 
book in paperback and save 
£8. x Hawking disagreed: 'It 
has sold one copy for every 
750 men, women and 
children in the world, so there 



are 749 to go.' 'Hawking 
logic! ' chimed in his nurse.- 

Stephen and Jane 
Hawking finalized their 
divorce that spring. In July, 
Stephen made the first public 
announcement of his 
engagement and upcoming 
marriage to Elaine at the 
Aspen Music Festival in 
Colorado, at a concert to 
benefit the Festival and 
Music School and the Aspen 



Center for Physics. - 

Hawking 's short, joyful 
speech introduced a 
performance of Richard 
Wagner's Siegfried Idyll. 
Unlike most of Wagner's 
compositions, this is intimate 
chamber music and requires 
only a small ensemble of 
musicians. It has a romantic 
history. Wagner composed it 
to be played at his villa, on 
the staircase outside the 



bedroom of his wife Cosima 
as a surprise on Christmas 
morning 1870, her birthday. 
The couple had married the 
summer before. The Idyll was 
an inspired choice for 
Hawking ' s engagement 
announcement. It combines 
gentle tenderness and passion 
in a way that is almost unique 
in the literature. Elaine 
fondled Stephen's shoulder 
lovingly as he exited the stage 



and the music began. The 
physicist David Schramm, 
chairman of the board of the 
Aspen Center for Physics, 
commented: 'There is a 
warmth - a caring expression 
in Stephen's eyes when he 
looks at Elaine. There is a 
very special relationship 
between them.'- Two months 
later, on 16 September 1995, 
Stephen and Elaine were 
married in a ceremony in a 



Cambridge registry office, 
followed by a church blessing 
and a celebration. None of his 
three children or her two boys 
were present. Hawking had a 
statement programmed and 
ready in his computer: 'It's 
wonderful - I have married 
the woman I love.'- 

The press reaction at the 
time of their marriage was not 
kind, questioning Elaine's 
motives for marrying this 



extremely wealthy man who 
was probably not going to 
live very long. Interviewers 
must have hoped that Elaine's 
former husband, David 
Mason, would provide some 
snide quotation, but he came 
to Elaine's defence. All 
Elaine really wanted, he said, 
was someone who needed 
her.- Elaine apparently 
needed Hawking too, for he 
replied to a question about his 



reasons for marrying Elaine 
that 'It's time I helped 
someone else. All my adult 
life people have been helping 
me.' 2 After his wedding, 
Hawking consistently 
declined to answer press 
questions - and those from 
curious audiences - about his 
marriage. 'I would rather not 
go into details of my private 
life' was his standard reply. - 
Amidst the concerned 



rumours and the less well- 
meaning gossip that would 
surface about Stephen's and 
Elaine's life together, there 
would be one consistent 
theme expressed by those 
who know him best. The 
bottom line was 'He loves 
Elaine.' 

Jane Hawking was in 
Seattle visiting her son 
Robert when the engagement 
announcement was made. 



When she got back to 
Cambridge, she began to 
reconsider an earlier decision 
not to write her memoirs as 
Hawking's wife. She had 
tried in vain to find a 
publisher for a book she was 
writing about 'Le Moulin', a 
home that she bought and 
restored in France. That book 
offered invaluable advice and 
practical information for 
others who might 



contemplate doing the same. 
Publishers, however, wanted 
a book about her personal life 
with Hawking, not about Le 
Moulin. One unscrupulous 
agent tricked her into signing 
a contract that promised a 
'tell-all' later, if the publisher 
agreed to take the book she 
was writing now. Jane had 
waited out the term of that 
contract and then, in 1994, 
self-published At Home in 



France. 

In the summer and 
autumn of 1995, with 
everything changed, Stephen 
married to Elaine, and 
Jonathan and herself living 
openly together in Cambridge 
with Jane's son Timothy, it 
seemed to her that the time 
had come to tell the entire 
'Hawking story' from her 
own much less up-beat point 
of view. A letter came from 



an editor at Macmillan 
Publishers, asking whether 
she would consider writing an 
autobiography. This time, 
Jane said yes.- 

Tea and a Lecture 

When I visited Hawking for 
tea in the DAMTP in the 
spring of 1996, his book with 
Roger Penrose, The Nature of 
Space and Time, had recently 
appeared. One particular 



statement in the book had 
annoyed some critics.— 
Hawking had re-emphasized 
something he'd been saying 
for at least a decade, that a 
theory in physics 'is just a 
mathematical model and it is 
meaningless to ask whether it 
corresponds to reality. All 
that one can ask is whether its 
predictions agree with 
observation.' 11 The rest of us 
may be curious, but Hawking 



was insisting, and would 
continue to insist, that it is 
meaningless to discuss such 
questions as whether 
wormholes really exist. 

Over tea, I pursued those 
ideas a little further with him: 
all right, granted, it is 
pointless to ask whether this 
theory corresponds to reality. 
But, is there, actually, an 
answer to that question? Is 
there reality, inaccessible to 



us perhaps, but solid reality, 
all the same? To say there is 
none at all, on any level, is to 
take a very postmodern view 
of things. Hawking 's reply 
was interesting: 'We never 
have a model-independent 
view of reality. But that does 
not mean there is no model- 
independent reality. If I didn't 
think there is, I could not 
continue to do science.'- In 
The Nature of Space and 



Time, a collection of six 
lectures that Hawking and 
Penrose had delivered at the 
Newton Institute in 
Cambridge in 1994, giving 
insights into the two men's 
differing philosophical and 
scientific points of view, 
Hawking commented: 4 1 think 
Penrose is a Platonist at heart 
but he must answer for 
himself. ' — Hawking ' s 

comment to me would 



certainly make him a 
Platonist too. M 

We had our tea in the 
common room surrounded as 
usual by the bustling herd of 
students and physicists, their 
dress still casual to the point 
of scruffy, their language still 
a mixture of English and 
mathematics, conversations 
ranging across the span and 
history of the universe, 
equations scribbled on the 



surfaces of the low tables. In 
this company, it occurred to 
me, Hawking has never been 
treated as anyone 
extraordinary, though his 
colleagues and students are 
willing to outwait the long 
pauses while he composes his 
sentences, and consider what 
he says worth the wait. 
Because of his lack of body 
language and vocal nuance, 
the synthesized voice conveys 



only one mood: infinite, 
thoughtful patience, lending 
an oracular air to his 
statements. His humour, 
whether he intends it that way 
or not, comes across as dry 
wit. 

Tea was cut short that 
afternoon because Hawking 
was scheduled to give a 
public lecture. The tickets had 
all been distributed through 
the university weeks ago. 



Someone suggested that I 
come along with his graduate 
and postdoctoral students, 
who would be admitted 
without tickets. It was a 
particularly kind suggestion, 
since I was at least twenty- 
five years older than any of 
them - the lecturer's age, not 
theirs. 

The lecture was a media 
event: sound trucks outside 
the building, cables snaking 



in, spotlights focused on the 
stage and the audience. The 
lecture hall was modern and 
large, though not nearly so 
capacious as others around 
the world that Hawking 
appearances routinely packed 
to the rafters. About 500 
people sat on long, curved, 
desklike benches, others 
crowded into the balconies 
above us. There was a hush as 
Hawking rolled on to the 



platform. Something about 
that calm, ordinary, 
inexorable progress to centre 
stage gave it the aura of a 
visitation from another 
dimension. He had pre- 
programmed the lecture into 
his computer. An assistant 
worked a slide projector. 
Even when the lecture and 
slides included formulas and 
diagrams that few could 
follow, Hawking commanded 



rapt attention. 

At that time, Hawking 
was also busy with another 
television project, to be aired 
the next year. Stephen 
Hawking 's Universe and a 
companion book to go with it 
was a six-part collaboration 
between the BBC and Public 
Television in America. This 
time he got his way when he 
insisted the series stick to 
science. 



Jane and Jonathan Hellyer 
Jones were married in July 
1997. Earlier that year, in 
March, Lucy had told the 
family that she and her 
fiance, Alex Mackenzie 
Smith, a member of the 
United Nations Peace Corps 
in Bosnia, were expecting a 
child. They planned to live 
together in London, and were 
married later that spring. 
They named Hawking 's first 



grandchild William, which is 
of course Stephen's middle 
name.— 

Censorship on a 
Cosmic Level 

It was time to concede 
another bet. The background 
of this one began in 1970, 
when Hawking was first 
thinking about the light rays 
at the event horizon of a 



black hole and what would 
happen if they approached 
each other, collided, and fell 
into the black hole. The 
question was, could a black 
hole ever end up with no 
horizon, with the singularity 
left 'naked', exposed to view? 
Roger Penrose had proposed 
a 'cosmic censorship 
conjecture' that a 

singularity would always be 
clothed inside a horizon. The 



discussion had gone on 
through the years, and 
Hawking had bet Kip Thorne 
and John Preskill (also of 
Caltech) that Penrose was 
right. The loser would reward 
the winner or winners with 
'clothing to cover the 
winner's nakedness, to be 
embroidered with a suitable 
concessionary message ' . 
Since 1991, when the bet was 
made and signed, Demetrios 



Christodoulou of Princeton, 
using computer simulations 
by Matthew Choptuik at the 
University of Texas, had done 
some theoretical calculations 
which suggested that a 
singularity without an event 
horizon might be created 
under very unlikely special 
circumstances such as a 
collapsing black hole. The 
situation was about as likely 
as balancing a pencil upright 



on its sharpened tip, said 
Choptuik, but it was 
theoretically not impossible. 

Hawking conceded the 
bet at a public lecture in 
California in 1997. The 
message in the 'embroidery' 
on the T-shirts he gave 
Thorne and Preskill indicated 
that although a naked 
singularity could happen, it 
probably wouldn't or 
shouldn't! The cartoon image 



showed a shapely woman 
barely concealing her 
nakedness behind a towel 
with the words 'Nature 
Abhors a Naked Singularity'. 
When Christodoulou redid his 
calculations, he found that 
Hawking 's concession had 
probably been premature, so a 
new wager was made. This 
time it was clearly spelled out 
that the singularity would 
have to happen without any 



unlikely special conditions 
and the loser's message on 
the garment would have to be 
unambiguously 
concessionary. Preskill had 
meanwhile made the remark 
that we do know of one naked 
singularity, the Big Bang.- 

Hawking made a 
particularly memorable 
journey in 1997. He, with Kip 
Thorne and several of their 
colleagues, visited Antarctica. 



Photographs show him 
bundled up in his wheelchair 
against a background of ice 
and snow. He didn't actually 
get to the South Pole, 
however, and he's never been 
to the North Pole, which 
means he can't say he has 
personally observed that there 
are no boundaries there. 



Speeding Up! 

In January 1998, at a meeting 



of the American 

Astronomical Society, a 
young astronomer named 
Saul Perlmutter made an 
announcement that rivalled in 
significance Hubble' s 

discovery that the universe is 
expanding: the expansion of 
the universe is speeding up! 
Cosmologists' jaws dropped. 
The media soon got the news 
out that something stunning 
had turned up, something that 



ran completely counter to all 
expectations. In the afterword 
to the new 2010 edition of his 
book with Roger Penrose, 
The Nature of Space and 
Time, Hawking exclaimed 
about the excitement and 
importance of this startling 
development. 

Two teams of 
astronomers made the 
discovery independently: 
Perlmutter and his Supernova 



Cosmology Project of the 
Lawrence Berkeley National 
Laboratory in California had 
been studying supernovae to 
find out whether the 
expansion of the universe was 
slowing down. They had 
discovered quite the opposite. 
It was difficult to believe they 
were not mistaken, but in 
March another research 
group, this one led by Brian 
Schmidt of the Mount 



Stromlo and Siding Spring 
Observatory in Australia, 
reported similar findings. 

Inflation theory was 
predicting a flat universe, 
while this new data seemed to 
be hinting that we might 
instead have an open universe 
(Friedmann's second model, 
see Figure 6.1 ); but another 
implication of the discovery 
wasn't so bad for inflation 
theory. What Perlmutter had 



found could be taken as the 
first strong observational 
evidence that there is a 
repulsive force operating in 
the universe, that the type of 
antigravity acceleration which 
inflation theory had suggested 
really does exist. The 
universe is getting an 
antigravity boost from 
somewhere. 

Were we seeing evidence 
of the cosmological constant 



Einstein had put into his 
equations of general relativity 
when he didn't believe what 
they were implying? He had, 
of course, taken it out again. 
Now Perlmutter suggested 
that there is, after all, a small 
positive cosmological 
constant, and Hawking and 
many others agreed that was 
the simplest explanation.- 
But there was some unease 
with this conclusion. Things 



might not be quite that 
simple. Perhaps there is a 
more exotic antigravity stress 
in the universe. There was 
talk of a mysterious 
'quintessence' (named after a 
fifth element suggested by 
Aristotle). 

'Dark energy' entered the 
physics vocabulary to 
describe the mysterious 
energy source. And energy, 
we know from Einstein's 



most familiar equation, has an 
equivalence with matter. One 
suggestion was that, added to 
ordinary matter and 'dark 
matter' (whose makeup is 
still mysterious but whose 
presence is well confirmed), 
dark energy might actually 
produce precisely the flat 
universe that inflation theory 
was predicting. In the 
afterword to the 2010 edition 
of The Nature of Space and 



Time, Hawking suggested 
that the presence of enough of 
this energy might even 
produce the positive 
curvature necessary for the 
closed universe consistent 
with the original no-boundary 
proposal.- However, in 1998, 
Hawking was beginning to 
think he might take another 
look at that proposal in the 
light of this unexpected 
discovery. 



Nearing the 
millennium 

In 1998, President Bill 
Clinton announced the 
Millennium Evening series - 
eight lectures and cultural 
showcases to be hosted by the 
White House and carried live 
over the internet - and invited 
Hawking to be one of the 
lecturers. His lecture 
'Imagination and Change: 



Science in the Next 
Millennium', was the second 
event in the series, on 6 
March. He used the 
opportunity to warn about 
what he saw as serious 
dangers - overpopulation and 
unchecked energy 
consumption. Hawking 
thought there was a 
possibility that we will 
destroy all life on Earth or 
'descend into a state of 



brutalism and barbarity'. He 
also expressed his grave 
doubts that any laws or bans 
would stop all attempts to 
redesign human DNA in the 
next millennium. No matter 
that most people would 
approve a legal ban on human 
genetic engineering, that 
would not prevent someone 
somewhere from doing it. 
Perhaps because he didn't 
want to leave his listeners 



completely devastated, he 
ended in a more upbeat 
mood: 'I'm an optimist, I 
think we have a good chance 
of avoiding both Armageddon 
and a new Dark Age.'— 

America seemed to bring 
out both a darker and a more 
light-hearted side of 
Hawking. Back in California 
again in 1999, he flew from 
Monterey, where he was 
staying, to Los Angeles to do 



the voice of himself in an 
episode of The Simpsons. 
This assignment was of truly 
vital importance to him, as 
witness the fact that when his 
wheelchair broke down two 
days before the flight, his 
graduate assistant Chris 
Burgoyne worked for a 
straight thirty-six hours to 
repair it in time. If Hawking 
couldn't rescue the entire 
human race from 



Armageddon, he could at 
least get to Los Angeles in 
time to 'Save Lisa's Brain'. 
The line best remembered 
from the episode was 
Hawking telling Homer that 
Homer's theory of a 
doughnut-shaped universe 
was 'interesting' and that 'I 
may have to steal it.' 
Hawking asked the producers 
whether it might be possible 
to create an 'action figure' of 



him. That went on the market 
and became a bestseller in toy 
stores. Hawking (again doing 
the voice-over) also came to 
the rescue of the whole 
universe in an episode of 
Dilbert in which a machine 
accidentally created a black 
hole. Dogbert kidnapped 
Hawking in order to get him 
to repair spacetime. Needless 
to say, Dr Hawking cured the 
universe. Hawking went in 



for repairs himself that year. 
Surgery to reroute his larynx 
to prevent food falling into 
his lungs made eating a less 
hazardous and more 
enjoyable activity. 

In the late 1980s, when I 
first wrote about Stephen 
Hawking, it seemed 
inappropriate indeed 
impossible to describe 
details of the Hawkings' 
private lives that only a very 



few people knew. All of this 
hidden information became 
public knowledge in 1999 
with the publication of Jane 
Hawking 's Music to Move the 
Stars. She was unsparingly 
frank about her memories of 
the physical and emotional 
turmoil of their lives and 
about her relationship with 
Jonathan Hellyer Jones. It 
surprised hardly anyone that 
Jane's book caused a 



sensation in the media, but all 
the furore did seem to come 
as something of a shock to 
Jane. Hawking made no 
public comment except that 
he never read biographies 
about himself. His humour 
survived, as witness his reply 
to a reporter asking him about 
Jane's book, who also asked 
whether he had willed his 
DNA to science for cloning: 
'I don't think anyone would 



want another copy of me.'— 

Hawking had appeared in 
an opera and on television, 
and had a film made about 
him. He had not yet been a 
character in a play. When he 
received an advance script of 
Robin Hawdon's God and 
Stephen Hawking, his 
reaction was to ignore it in 
the hope it would go away 
and never reach the stage. 
When Hawdon added details 



from Jane's book, Hawking 
considered taking legal action 
but decided that would just 
attract more attention to a 
play that was 'stupid and 
worthless'.- God, the Pope, 
the Queen, Jane Hawking, 
Einstein and Newton were 
also characters. Lucy saw a 
performance and, watching 
her family portrayed on stage, 
found herself both 'horrified 
and mesmerized', fighting an 



'insane urge to climb on the 
stage and join them'.- 

Meanwhile, Hawking was 
broadening his horizons in a 
different direction at the 
behest of his son Tim, now a 
university student in Exeter. 
Unlike his older brother, Tim 
had not followed his father 
into physics but instead was 
studying French and Spanish 
as his mother had done. Tim 
managed to interest his father 



in Formula One racing and 
even enticed him to rock 
concerts. Hawking claimed 
he really enjoyed some of 
these, but he left one concert 
for which the tickets had been 
particularly difficult to obtain 
after only twenty minutes. 
This life-long Wagner fan 
(though his speech 
synthesizer insisted on 
pronouncing it 'Werner' or 
'Wagoner') was also a 



discerning enough rock fan to 
know what he liked and what 
not - and vote with his 
wheels. 

A Meeting of 
Theories - No 
Boundaries and 
Inflation 

In the late 1990s, as the end 
of the millennium 
approached, Hawking ' s 



reputation among his 
colleagues and his public 
celebrity seemed secure, but 
his and Jim Hartle's no- 
boundary proposal was still 
controversial. It predicted a 
closed universe, the first of 
Friedmann's models ( see 
Figure 6.1 ). In that model, the 
universe would eventually 
collapse to a Big Crunch. The 
discovery that the expansion 
of the universe is speeding 



up, and better-informed 
estimates of the amount of 
matter and energy in the 
universe, were increasingly 
causing theorists in the late 
1990s to doubt the possibility 
that ours is that kind of 
universe. It was even looking 
likely to be an 'open' 
universe, Friedmann's second 
model, which expands for 
ever. 

At the same time, 



inflation theory was 
predicting that the universe is 
'flat', Friedmann ' s third 
model, meaning that the 
amount of matter in it is just 
right, not too much and not 
too little, to cause the 
universe to expand only 
barely fast enough to avoid 
collapse. In 1995, Neil Turok, 
Martin Bucher and Alfred 
Goldhaber at the State 
University of New York 



Stony Brook had written a 
paper showing that inflation 
did not necessarily rule out an 
open universe, expanding for 
ever - but this was no 
immediate help for the no- 
boundary proposal.- 

With his no-boundary 
proposal predicting a closed 
universe, inflation theory a 
flat or perhaps open one, and 
observations leaning towards 
an open one, Hawking began 



to consider the possibility of 
bringing these models into 
agreement. Neil Turok was a 
good friend, and over cups of 
tea one day after a Cambridge 
seminar on open inflation the 
two began sharing ideas. 

The upshot was a model 
in which a particle of space 
and time resembling an 
extremely small, slightly 
irregular, wrinkled sphere in 
four dimensions would 



automatically inflate itself 
into an infinite, open 
universe.- Because this 
particle would have lasted for 
only an instant before 
undergoing inflation, just a 
flash in the pan, so to speak, 
Hawking and Turok named it 
the 'instanton'. But 'pea' was 
the name that caught on with 
the public, because the two 
theorists announced that 
though it was unimaginably 



tinier than a pea, it had the 
mass of a pea (about one 
gram). The pea image was 
also useful because a pea is 
round, which goes nicely with 
the rounded 'origin' of the 
universe, where time was like 
a fourth dimension of space, 
in the no-boundary proposal. 
A pea is not a singularity. Not 
a point of infinite density. In 
Neil Turok's words: 



Think of inflation as 
being the dynamite 
that produced the big 
bang. Our instanton is 
a sort of self-lighting 
fuse that ignites 
inflation. To have our 
instanton, you have to 
have gravity, matter, 
space and time. Take 
any one ingredient 
away, and our 
instanton doesn't 



exist. But if you have 
an instanton, it will 
instantly turn into an 
inflating, infinite 
universe.- 



Nothing existed 'outside' 
the instanton, and nothing 
existed 'before' it. In both 
time and space, it was all 
there was. However, claims 
in the media that this theory 
showed how the universe 



sprang into being from 
nothing were far from the 
mark. It sprang into being 
from a 'combination of 
gravity, space, time, and 
matter packed into a rounded 
minuscule object'. - 

It was a good try, 
bringing together inflation 
theory, the no-boundary 
condition and observational 
evidence, but it was not an 
immediate hit with 



Hawking ' s and Turok ' s 
colleagues. One rather 
embarrassing problem was 
that many of the possible 
universes the model predicted 
had no matter in them at all. 
That, however, was not too 
difficult for Hawking to 
remedy. One could use the 
anthropic principle and say 
that, in fact, only one of the 
possible universes had to 
support the existence of 



intelligent life forms. 

Criticism came from 
those who found the no- 
boundary proposal still too 
controversial to be used 
dependably as part of a 
meaningful theory. Others 
thought Hawking and Turok 
were relying too heavily on 
the anthropic principle. 
Andrei Linde was very 
critical. To his way of 
thinking, a model with 



universes that included at 
best only about one-thirtieth 
the density of matter 
currently observed in our 
universe was unacceptable. 
Not even the anthropic 
principle could save it. 
Hawking and Turok 
responded: so far they had 
been working with only a 
very simple model. A more 
realistic model would yield 
better results. 



Because of public interest 
in any news having to do with 
Hawking, the media on both 
sides of the Atlantic picked 
up the disagreement and 
treated it as though the 
theoretical-physics world 
were staging its own Clash of 
the Titans. 'Give Peas a 
Chance!'- urged Astronomy 
Magazine, while Science 
showed more restraint with 
'Inflation Confronts an Open 



Universe'.— The online news 
service at Stanford, where 
Linde was a professor, 
announced it like a prize 
fight: 'Hawking, Linde Spar 
over Birth of the Universe'.— 
Hawking 's name headed that 
title, even though Linde was 
now a local boy, but perhaps 
Stanford Report Online had 
decided that no one could be 
faulted for sticking to 
alphabetical order. 



If Linde had once found 
Hawking intimidating, that 
was no longer the case. He 
called Hawking 'an extremely 
talented person',- 'a very 
brilliant man',- but also 
commented that Hawking 's 
faith in mathematics bordered 
on a religion,- and that 
'Sometimes - this is my 
interpretation - he trusts 
mathematics so much that he 
makes calculations first and 



interprets them later.'- 'You 
need to make sure that you 
are applying the mathematics 
correctly. In this case, my 
intuition tells me that he has 
not done so.' M In one highly 
complimentary statement, 
however, Linde echoed what 
many others have said about 
Hawking: 'I consider Stephen 
my friend and I hope we will 
remain friends after this is 
over. A number of times he 



has come up with surprising 
conclusions that at first seem 
like they are wrong. But in 
several instances he turned 
out to be right. In other cases, 
he was wrong. We will just 
have to wait and see which it 
is this time.'— 

The article in the Stanford 
online news was triggered by 
a seminar Hawking gave at 
Stanford in April, at Linde's 
invitation. The prospect of 



witnessing these two men 
'sparring' in person brought 
out a mammoth crowd. 
Hawking also debated with 
Linde and Alexander 
Vilenkin the next November 
in Monterey, California, this 
time defending his 
employment of the anthropic 
principle with a confidence 
that foreshadowed the much 
stronger use he would make 
of it in the future: 'The 



universe we live in didn't 
collapse early on or become 
almost empty. So we have to 
take account of the anthropic 
principle: if the universe 
hadn't been suitable for our 
existence, we wouldn't be 
asking why it is the way it 
is.'— When it came to 
Hawking ' s and Turok ' s 
proposal, the jury would be 
out a long time. 



16 



'It seems clear to me' 



in December 1999, on the eve 
of the millennium, CNN's 
Larry King came in person to 
Cambridge to the DAMTP to 
film an interview with 
Hawking, who carefully 
programmed the answers to 



prearranged questions into his 
computer to avoid any delay 
in replying. The interview 
was broadcast on Christmas 
Day. When Larry King asked 
him how he planned to 
celebrate this special New 
Year, Hawking replied that he 
was going to a Simpsons- 
character costume party, 
dressed as himself. This 
would not require a costume. 1 
The millennium found 



Hawking playing in the big 
leagues. He joined 
international luminaries 
among them Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu - in signing a 
'Charter for the Third 
Millennium on Disability'. In 
May 2000 he took issue with 
Prince Charles for opposing 
genetically modified food, 
and in August he recorded a 
televised tribute to US 
presidential candidate Al 



Gore, to be shown at the 
Democratic National 
Convention in the United 
States. 

His speaking 
engagements for audiences 
numbering in the thousands 
were continuing to take him 
worldwide, to South Korea, 
to Mumbai and Delhi in 
India, to Granada in Spain. 
He delivered a lecture at 
Caltech for Kip Thome's 



sixtieth-birthday 'KipFest' in 
June 2000, and another back 
home in Cambridge that 
raised thousands of pounds 
for the Newnham Croft 
Primary School to build a 
new extension. In the summer 
of 2001 a new documentary, 
The Real Stephen Hawking, 
aired on BBC4. Hawking 
called public attention to the 
need for new technology for 
the disabled by agreeing to 



advertise the Quantum Jazzy 
1400 Wheelchair. 4 It will 
keep my nurses fit as they try 
to keep up,' he quipped, and 
that was no exaggeration. 

'Try to keep up' they did. 
A trip abroad was, and is, like 
an army on the move: 
Hawking, his graduate 
assistant, a medical nurse, 
and two carers are the 
minimum. The amount of 
equipment and luggage that 



go with them has been 
prodigious ever since the 
1980s, when he began 
travelling with the computer 
and apparatus with which he 
communicates. Joan Godwin, 
who oversaw the 

transportation of all this 
paraphernalia back and forth 
across the world many times, 
says it includes the usual 
suitcases for clothing, the 
vital suction equipment for 



keeping his breathing 
passages open, and an 
extremely heavy black bag 
containing everything that 
might be necessary in case of 
an emergency. His graduate 
assistant brings along tools 
and equipment and spare 
parts necessary for 
maintenance and emergency 
repairs to the wheelchair and 
computer. Not surprisingly 
these items sometimes get 



lost in transit. Godwin recalls 
the crisis and emergency 
shopping trip when the 
suitcase with all Hawking 's 
clothes got shoved aside by 
baggage handlers and never 
made it to the next stop, 
where he was scheduled to 
meet Bill Gates. On another 
occasion, when she wasn't 
along on the journey, she 
received a frantic phone call 
from his staff on the other 



side of the world. The suction 
equipment was locked in a 
car and the keys lost. What 
should they do? 

Since the millennium, 
Hawking has been flying 
whenever possible by private 
jet. On a commercial flight, 
the wheelchair had to travel 
inside the plane to avoid a 
lengthy wait for him on the 
otherwise deserted plane until 
the baggage was brought out 



and the chair brought to him. 
It had even happened that the 
chair had its own first class 
seat. Security checks have 
been a perennial problem 
because the chair won't fit 
through the metal detector. 
Most of the time no one 
insists on searching him. It 
isn't only planes that are a 
challenge. Complicated 
special arrangements had to 
be made for the 'bullet train' 



in Japan to stop for an extra 
thirty seconds. 

Not long after the 
millennium, some of the same 
press that excitedly described 
all this coming and going and 
Hawking 's public 
appearances and honours 
seemed equally eager to 
report rumours that he was 
suffering mysterious physical 
abuse. When the Cambridge 
police initiated an 



investigation, Hawking 
resolutely refused to have any 
part in it. He dismissed the 
sometimes frantic concerns of 
staff and family, and firmly 
let it be known to police and 
all others that he wanted no 
interference in his and his 
wife's life. Intermittent 
investigations, rumours, and 
police interviews of 
colleagues, staff and family 
regarding an alleged series of 



'unexplained injuries', some 
of them allegedly life- 
threatening, went on for five 
years until, in March 2004, 
the police dropped the 
investigation. 

P-branes aren't So 
Dumb 

The millennium and the years 
immediately following found 
Andrei Linde and his 



collaborators working to 
connect string theory with the 
multiverse of eternal 
inflation, while Hawking and 
some of his current and 
former graduate students 
were putting their heads 
together (when Hawking 's 
head wasn't off in some 
remote part of the world) to 
bring the no-boundary 
proposal and a relatively new 
idea called 'brane' theory into 



line with one another. They 
were also continuing to look 
at black holes in the light of 
brane theory. 

The name 'p-brane' was 
coined by Peter Townsend, 
one of Hawking 's colleagues 
in the DAMTP who did 
fundamental work on these 
theoretical oddities. The 'p' 
in p-brane can be any 
number, the number 
indicating how many 



dimensions the 'brane' has. If 
p = 1, that's a 1 -brane. It has 
one dimension, length. It's a 
string. If p = 2, that's a 2- 
brane. It has two dimensions, 
length and width. It's a sheet 
or membrane. Continuing in 
this vein, we might decide 
that the infamous, deadly 
'gelatinous cube' of some 
adventure games must be a 3- 
brane - though that isn't part 
of the theory. Higher numbers 



for p are possible as well. 
They are more difficult to 
picture. The scheme is 
reminiscent of an idea that 
had emerged in the fifth 
century bc with the 
Pythagoreans and was later 
picked up by Plato, that the 
world is created in a 
progression from point to line 
to surface to solid. Plato 
speculated that there might be 
more dimensions to the 



progression after that, but 
these were all that were 
needed to have the world we 
know.- Modern p-brane 
theorists are far less 
restrained when it comes to 
considering those extra 
dimensions. 

P-branes can absorb and 
emit particles in the same 
way black holes do. At least 
for certain types of black 
holes, the p-brane model 



predicts the same emission 
rate that Hawking 's virtual 
particle-pair model predicts. 

The p-branes provide a 
sort of storage facility for 
information that falls into a 
black hole, but they might do 
better than that: the 
information emerges 
eventually in the radiation 
from the p-branes. 
Considering this possibility, 
Hawking was thinking again 



about the implication of the 
Heisenberg uncertainty 
principle that every region of 
space must be full of tiny 
black holes that appear and 
disappear as rapidly as the 
particle pairs in Hawking 
radiation. These little chaps 
gobble up particles and 
information. Of course, they 
are a hundred trillion times 
smaller than an atomic 
nucleus. Nibble might be a 



better word, which is why, 
said Hawking, the laws of 
physics still appear 
deterministic for everyday 
intents and purposes. That 
does not, however, mean the 
loss of information is any less 
serious. Could p-branes come 
to the rescue? 

After Hawking' s 1981 
announcement that 
information is lost from the 
universe in black holes, the 



controversy about the 
information paradox had 
continued, though 
surprisingly, given the 
significance of the issue for 
physics - not at a level that 
appeared to disturb Hawking 
or get a rise out of him as his 
thoughts turned to other 
matters. Some wondered 
whether he was simply being 
stubborn, choosing to ignore 
interesting arguments that 



contradicted his own ideas, 
refusing to move ahead and 
engage in the discussion. A 
few feared that he was simply 
not well enough to respond in 
a forceful and meaningful 
way. To him it seemed he had 
delivered the unassailable 
verdict, as unfortunate as that 
verdict was, and none of the 
arguments he was hearing 
were significant enough to 
pull him into the fray. 



However, the boss had 
not been asleep. He knew of 
Susskind's proposal in 1993; 
and the p-brane suggestion 
for solving the information 
paradox, coming in 1996 
from physicists Andrew 
Strominger and Cumrun 
Vafa, had definitely caught 
his attention. Hawking and 
his colleagues considered that 
solution to the information 
loss problem, and some had 



hopes for it. The giant stirred 
in his lair a little, but then 
turned over and remained 
unconvinced. Hawking stuck 
to his guns. Information is 
irretrievably lost in black 
holes. P-branes though 
interesting for other reasons - 
were not the answer. 
Nevertheless, when Hawking 
closed a lecture with the 
words, The future of the 
universe is not completely 



determined by the laws of 
science and its present state 
as Laplace thought, God still 
has a few tricks up his 
sleeve', and the last slide was 
a drawing showing an elderly, 
bearded figure with an 
enigmatic smile, slipping 
playing cards into the sleeve 
of his robe, one wondered . . . 
were those cards 2-branes? 



A Prehistory of the 



'Nutshell' 

The first I saw or heard of 
The Universe in a Nutshell 
was as a bundle of 
typewritten pages, sent to me 
by Ann Harris, Hawking 's 
editor at Bantam in New 
York in the summer of 2000. 
There were print-outs of 
public and scientific lectures 
and papers, most of them 
recent, some easy to 
understand, some full of 



equations and the language of 
physics, repetitious of one 
another in places and 
occasionally of previous 
Hawking books not 
resembling a coherent book at 
all. Here were string theory, 
M-theory, imaginary time, 
sums-over-histories, the 
information paradox, the 
holographic principle, extra 
dimensions, not to mention 
summaries of more basic 



subjects such as quantum 
mechanics, general relativity, 
black holes and the Big Bang. 
It was an awful lot of material 
and it definitely was not in a 
nutshell ... yet. Could it 
possibly make a book, Ann 
Harris wanted to know. 
Stephen Hawking was one of 
the jewels in her and 
Bantam's crown. It was 
unthinkable to send this back 
to him and say it couldn't be 



published. 

I agreed to take a look at 
this material and soon found 
myself completely absorbed. 
For Ann I produced glosses in 
the margins: This is what he 
is saying ...', or 'too 
technical', or 
'understandable', or 'already 
said this on p. 33', and I 
created a map showing how 
the various pieces, and pieces 
of pieces, could be rearranged 



and linked in such a way that 
they would be chapters in a 
book. Ann Harris took me on 
board with the brief of 
'helping Hawking make the 
book simpler so that ordinary 
people can understand it'. 
The 'ordinary people' was no 
problem. I was one of them 
myself. 

As it turned out, Stephen 
Hawking was ahead of both 
Ann Harris and myself. He 



had a perfectly good plan of 
his own for how this book 
would fit together. The 
nonlinear organization was 
intentional. There would be 
separate chapters, each on its 
own topic, that could be read 
in any order after mastering a 
small core of essential 
material. My task became to 
help smooth out the un- 
evenness in the difficulty 
levels of the chapters, to point 



out where some of them 
needed work to bring them to 
a level accessible to 
intelligent general readers. 
Hawking decided to use the 
opportunity to stress again 
some of his opinions on 
controversial issues beyond 
the realm of his science. After 
several months 
communicating by e-mail, we 
worked together for two 
weeks in his office in 



Cambridge. Also on board 
was a fantastic illustrator, 
Philip Dunn, from Book 
Laboratory and Moonrunner 
Design. At first I worried 
about the scientific accuracy 
of some of his drawings, but, 
in the end, his pictures made 
Nutshell the most 
innovatively illustrated of all 
Hawking 's books. 



Not Silver Street 



By the year 2000, there had 
been a dramatic change for 
the DAMTP. Though the 
new, ultra-modern complex 
called the Centre for 
Mathematical Sciences would 
not be complete until 2002, 
the DAMTP had already 
moved there from the old 
building in Silver Street when 
I came to work with Hawking 
on The Universe in a 
Nutshell. Instead of crossing 



the Backs and the River Cam 
to reach the new complex 
from where I was staying at 
Clare Hall, I walked in the 
opposite direction, away from 
central, ancient Cambridge, 
through an upscale residential 
section of town, in the 
direction of the New 
Cavendish Labs but not quite 
so far. The new Centre for 
Mathematical Sciences was 
still a work in progress but it 



already looked like something 
out of Star Trek, except for 
the 'green' (literally - turf- 
covered) roof of one section. 
No longer could I walk 
straight in. I had to be fetched 
from Reception by 
Hawking 's personal assistant, 
whom I hadn't met before, 
Karen Simes. 

Hawking 's new office 
was a vast improvement over 
the old one in Silver Street. It 



was spacious, carpeted, 
modern, light-filled from two 
walls of windows. A 'corner 
office'. There was room not 
only for his desk, computers, 
bookcases and a blackboard, 
but also for a plush sofa, 
chairs and a coffee table for 
guests, all in muted designer 
colours. Marilyn Monroe 
surveyed the scene from a 
framed, pastel portrait, much 
more upmarket than the one I 



remembered hanging in 
Silver Street. Most of the 
photographs on the desk and 
shelves were of William, 
Lucy's little boy, Hawking 's 
grandchild. The windows 
overlooked lawns two storeys 
below and the older, well-to- 
do residential area 
surrounding the complex. 
This view was not to last, I 
was told, for the Centre was 
still being built and would 



soon include another 
'pavilion' a few yards outside 
the windows. Nevertheless, 
the outlook was a 
considerable improvement 
over the old car park and the 
blank brick wall. 

It seemed a serious loss, 
however, that the only room 
in the new complex that was 
vaguely comparable to the 
common room in Silver 
Street was a large dining 



facility a good distance down 
corridors and across outdoor 
ramps and bridges from 
Hawking 's office. Its size and 
remoteness meant that it 
didn't lend itself as the old 
shabby common room had to 
writing equations on tables 
and having impromptu 
informal seminars over tea or 
coffee at 4 p.m. That situation 
would have to be remedied. 
The building was 



nevertheless impressive in its 
technical marvels. Window 
blinds ground up and down 
without human intervention 
in response to the intensity of 
the light. They also went 
down at night because of 
complaints from 
neighbouring homes that the 
size and brightness of this 
ultra-modern monstrosity 
gave the impression that we 
need no longer wonder 



whether extraterrestrial life 
exists ... it had landed, in 
force, across the street. The 
building also 'breathed' 
occasionally; papers fluttered 
as air was drawn 
automatically through vents, 
doors and windows. 

In spite of all this 
modernity and innovation, the 
clicking sounds of the little 
box Hawking held in his 
hand, the flitting words on the 



screen, the synthetic voice, 
were exactly as I remembered 
them. Some of the nurses 
were familiar faces. 

Though I had been 
communicating with 
Hawking by e-mail for 
several months before coming 
back to Cambridge, it was a 
relief to find, in person, that 
neither the move to the new 
building nor his continuing 
world travels and celebrity, 



nor becoming a grandfather, 
nor changes in his personal 
life, had kept him from going 
right ahead with the work he 
loved and to which he had 
devoted so many years of 
unexpected and triumphant 
survival. The boss was still 
awake. Our conversations 
were not, of course, like 
ordinary conversation. Using 
his hand-held device, he 
would send the cursor on the 



screen off on a hell-for- 
leather pursuit of each single 
word across the half- screens 
and lines full of words, and 
finally attempt to capture the 
word itself, often missing it, 
and the process would start 
over again. I knew I must 
resist the temptation to 
complete sentences for him, 
even when I could tell what 
he was going to say. That 
would be impolite, and he 



might very well go right 
ahead and finish the sentence 
anyway. So I waited and 
watched, and silently rooted 
for the cursor to capture the 
word. 'Come on! ... there! ... 
got it ... oh no!' I found 
myself pumping my fist and 
stopped. Were there any 
expletives programmed into 
his phrase lists? I don't know. 
After only a few minutes of 
frustration at the beginning of 



the two weeks, I calmed 
down. It was necessary to 
take his cue, be patient and 
allow it all to happen his way. 
He wasn't frustrated - or 
maybe he was, but he 
couldn't show it. 

Our work together on The 
Universe in a Nutshell 
consisted in the main of my 
pointing out paragraphs, 
sentences and sometimes 
larger pieces of the 



manuscript that I thought 
needed to be stated in simpler 
language. I had prepared 
alternative wording, but in all 
instances, though he listened 
to my suggestions, he insisted 
on making the changes in his 
own words. Sometimes my 
comment, 'I think that 
sentence is too difficult, 
Stephen', would bring forth 
the vintage Hawking smile, a 
storm of clicking and 



flickering words and the 
reply, 'It seems clear to me.' 
But he would set to work 
remedying the problem, 
laboriously translating the 
language of theoretical 
physics into the language of 
' ordinary people ' . Only 
occasionally, when the 
translation still didn't seem 
simple enough, did I resort to 
saying, 'I'm sorry, but / can't 
understand that', even if I 



thought maybe I could. He 
would reply, Til make it 
simpler then', and he did. 

One of the most 
interesting suggestions he 
was making in The Universe 
in a Nutshell was that we may 
live on a four- dimensional 
surface within a higher 
dimensional spacetime. Such 
a surface had been dubbed a 
'brane world'. 

If we lived in such a 



situation, everything in our 
own four-dimensional brane 
world, what we normally call 
'the universe' - matter and 
light, for instance - would 
behave just the way we have 
found it does in the universe 
we know, with the exception 
of gravity. Gravity (thought 
of as the curved spacetime of 
general relativity) would 
spread throughout the higher 
dimensional spacetime, and 



because this was so, we 
would find gravity behaving 
oddly. For one thing, it would 
grow weaker with distance 
more rapidly than we have 
experienced it doing. 

Here there was a hitch, 
for if the gravitational force 
fell off more rapidly with 
distance, the planets couldn't 
orbit as they do. They would 
fall into the sun or escape to 
interstellar space. We don't 



find that happening. 
However, suppose the extra 
dimensions didn't spread too 
far but ended on another 
brane world fairly near our 
home brane world - a shadow 
brane world that we couldn't 
see because light, as we've 
said, would be confined to its 
own brane world and not 
spread through the space in 
between brane worlds. It 
might be only a millimetre 



away from us but 
undetectable because that 
millimetre is measured in 
some extra spatial dimension. 
Imagine an analogy in a two- 
dimensional world: there are 
insects on a piece of paper, 
with another piece of paper 
hovering near it and parallel. 
The insects are unaware of 
the other piece of paper 
because they can't conceive 
of a third dimension of space. 



They know only the two 
dimensions of their piece of 
paper. If the extra dimensions 
ended on such a shadow 
brane world, then for 
distances larger than the 
separation between the brane 
worlds, gravity would not be 
able to spread out freely after 
all. Just like the other forces 
of nature, we would find it 
effectively confined to our 
home brane world, and it 



would fall off with distance 
just as we expect it to - at the 
right rate for planetary orbits. 

However, there would be 
tell-tale clues. For distances 
less than the separation 
between the brane worlds, 
gravity would vary more 
rapidly, and these variations 
ought to show up in 
measurements of the very 
small gravitational effect 
between heavy objects placed 



extremely short distances 
apart. 

There are other interesting 
implications: a nearby 
'shadow' brane world would 
be invisible to us, because 
light from that brane world 
could not spread to ours, but 
we would feel and observe 
the gravitational effects of 
matter on that neighbouring 
brane. Those effects would be 
mysterious to us, because 



they would appear to be 
produced by sources that we 
cannot detect at all except 
through their gravity. 

Is that the explanation 
behind the 'missing mass' 
and 'dark matter' mystery in 
astrophysics? For stars, 
galaxies and galaxy clusters 
to be situated as they are and 
to move as they do, there has 
got to be much more matter 
in the universe than we can 



observe in any part of the 
electromagnetic spectrum. 
Could it be we are observing 
the gravitational influence of 
matter in other brane worlds? 

There are other brane 
world models besides the one 
involving shadow branes, and 
speculation about the 
implications of the models 
has extended to many 
subjects which are of 
enormous interest to 



Hawking, such as black 
holes, radiation at the event 
horizon, black hole 
evaporation, gravity waves, 
the relative weakness of 
gravity in comparison with 
the other forces of nature, the 
origin of the universe and its 
history in imaginary time, 
inflation theory, the Planck 
length, and the no-boundary 
proposal. 

How does the no- 



boundary proposal look when 
viewed through brane world 
glasses? 

Our home brane world 
would have a history in 
imaginary time that was like a 
four-dimensional sphere, that 
is, like the surface of the 
Earth but with two more 
dimensions. So far - if you 
have read the previous 
chapters of this book - that 
ought to sound familiar. The 



difference is that in the 
original no-boundary 
proposal there was nothing 
'inside' the expanding sphere, 
the 'globe of the world' that 
Hawking asked us to picture. 
In the new brane world 
version that is not the case. 
Inside the bubble is higher 
dimensional space, and the 
volume of that space, as 
might be expected, increases 
as the brane world expands. 



In the chronological time 
we experience, our home 
brane world would expand 
with an inflationary phase 
like that described in inflation 
theory. The most probable 
scenario would be one in 
which it expanded for ever at 
the inflationary rate, never 
allowing stars and galaxies to 
form. But we could not exist 
in such a brane world, and we 
do obviously exist. So the 



anthropic principle compels 
us to find out whether the 
brane world model offers 
other less likely but not 
impossible scenarios. It does. 
We find that there are 
imaginary time histories that 
could correspond to real time 
behaviour in which the brane 
world had a phase of 
accelerating inflationary 
expansion only at first but 
then slowed down. After that, 



galaxies could have formed 
and intelligent life evolved. 
That sounds more familiar. 

The most mind-boggling 
suggestion having to do with 
branes had been inspired by 
our knowledge of 
holography. Recall Leonard 
Susskind's suggestion about 
the way holography might 
apply to black holes. In 
holography, information 
about what happens in a 



region of spacetime can be 
encoded on its boundary. 
Hawking leaves us with the 
question of whether we might 
only think we live in a four- 
dimensional world because 
we are shadows cast on the 
brane by what is happening in 
the interior of the bubble. 

The work on Nutshell 
would continue later for 
several months by e-mail, 
fine-tuning the editing, but, 



by and large, those two weeks 
when I was in Cambridge got 
the job done. It was exciting 
work, but it was also tense 
work. As I exited the car park 
of the Centre for 
Mathematical Studies on the 
final evening, I gave a silent 
cheer and did, finally, allow 
myself to pump my fist. We 
had done it! I had survived. 
So had Stephen Hawking. 



Dinner at Caius 

On one cold November 
evening during those two 
Cambridge weeks, I rode with 
Stephen Hawking in his van 
to Caius for dinner. The van 
stopped where King's Parade 
turns into Trinity Street, 
between the Senate House 
and Great St Mary's Church 
and across from Gonville and 
Caius College. The nurse who 
had driven us from the Centre 



for Mathematical Studies set 
the brakes, left the headlights 
burning, and came around to 
the passenger side to release 
the heavy harnesses that 
secured Hawking and his 
wheelchair where the 
passenger seat would usually 
be. I, the only backseat 
passenger, moved out of her 
way and waited in the street, 
since freeing the wheelchair 
was heavy work and required 



space to manoeuvre. The 
ubiquitous Cambridge 
cyclists dodged with lightning 
reflexes around me and the 
van. Soon they were also 
having to dodge the metal 
ramp that protruded from the 
door and allowed Hawking, 
bundled up against a cold 
wind, to guide his chair 
smoothly down on to the 
pavement. 

He made his way at a 



slow majestic pace through 
the Gonville and Caius gate 
and across three courtyards to 
the doorway that led to the 
Hall. After all those years, 
and all his success in the 
cause of disabled access, 
there was still no convenient 
way for Hawking to get to the 
Senior Common Room and 
the Hall of his college. There 
was space on the tiny lift only 
for him and his nurse. He 



instructed me and my 
husband, who had met us at 
the gate, how to find our way 
up by another route. We 
rejoined him as he threaded 
his way through the kitchens 
and other rooms that are not 
on the tourist circuit, although 
much of Caius is ancient and 
beautiful. In the richly 
panelled Senior Common 
Room a fire was burning, and 
Fellows of the college greeted 



Hawking in a manner that 
indicated they knew him well 
and had long ago stopped 
being surprised, shocked or 
impressed by his disability or 
his accomplishments. Some 
of them have equal claims to 
fame in their own academic 
fields, though not so much 
international notoriety. He is 
to them simply Stephen. 

After sherry, everyone 
proceeded to the Hall and 



took places at High Table, a 
step above the level of the 
long tables crowded with 
noisy undergraduates - for 
Caius is a college that still 
makes a serious commitment 
to dining in Hall. Graduate 
students of the college ate 
somewhat more calmly in the 
minstrels' gallery, sans 
minstrels. Amidst the 
pleasant clink of forks and 
knives on college china, the 



rumble of young voices, 
occasional outbursts of shouts 
and boisterous laughter, and 
the more well-modulated 
voices of the Fellows, we ate 
and drank a fine wine from 
the college cellars. Stephen 
Hawking 's nurse wrapped his 
huge bib around his chest and 
fed him, while he clicked on 
his hand-held device and, 
through his computer, 
discussed international 



politics with my husband. 

The Hall is hung with 
portraits of eminent fellows 
of Caius. Near the centre, 
prominently displayed, is a 
modern painting of Hawking. 
For centuries, men (and, more 
recently, women) have gone 
from this college and from 
those long, rowdy tables to 
teach, to continue research, to 
make money, to change the 
world. We ate, as they had, 



with this odd amalgam of the 
new, the antique, the 
remarkable, the ordinary, the 
wet-behind-the-ears, the 
venerable. The occasion was 
a little like dining at summer 
camp in a room that just 
happened to be hundreds of 
years old and incongruously 
beautiful. In this generation, 
Caius has taken in its stride 
one of the most 
extraordinarily different men 



of our time - whom everyone 
there seems to regard as just 
another camper. 

During the two weeks I 
spent in Hawking 's office in 
the autumn of 2000, working 
with him on The Universe in 
a Nutshell, I often would 
arrive at the DAMTP before 
he did and wait at the curved 
modern desk between his 
office door and the bridge 
from the lift in this 



supermodern 'pod'. Each day 
when the lift doors opened 
and his chair emerged, it 
seemed to me there was a tiny 
but profound alteration in the 
feel of reality, requiring a 
slight re-adjustment on my 
part. Even after I had learned 
to expect it, I couldn't escape 
the impression that a piece of 
another world - alien to me 
because of superior intellect 
and disability, but also for a 



quality of will that I have 
never experienced anywhere 
else - was moving in slow 
and inexorable progression 
through our space and time, 
from the little bridge to the 
office door, almost running 
over my toes. 

The mechanical voice 
would say, 'Good morning', 
or inquire, 'How are you?', or 
something like that ... and 
Hawking 's working day 



would begin. 



PART IV 
2000-20 1 1 



17 



'An expanding horizon 
of possibilities' 



in A statement in january 
2000, part of an interview for 
the millennium focusing on 
his predictions about what the 
future held in store for the 



human race, Hawking 
summed up his thoughts on 
the issue of genetic 
engineering. Humans, he 
said, have had no significant 
changes in their DNA over 
ten thousand years. But soon 
they will no longer have to 
wait for biological evolution 
to make changes for them - 
and they won't wait. In the 
next thousand years we will 
probably be able to redesign 



our DNA completely, 
increasing our brain size. 
Whatever bans are placed on 
genetic engineering in 
humans, it will surely be 
allowed on animals and 
plants for economic reasons, 
'and someone is bound to try 
it on humans unless we have 
a totalitarian world order. 
Someone will improve 
humans somewhere. I am not 
advocating human genetic 



engineering. I am just saying 
it is likely to happen and we 
should consider how to deal 
with it.' 1 

A year and a half later, he 
had changed his mind. In an 
interview given shortly before 
September 11, he told the 
German periodical Focus that 
humans would be well 
advised to modify their DNA 
in order to avoid being 
outdistanced by super- 



intelligent computers that 
would eventually rule the 
world.- Are computers really 
likely to become that 
intelligent? Hawking had 
previously commented that 
computers are 'less complex 
than the brain of an 
earthworm, a species not 
known for its intellectual 
powers'.- But he thought that 
'if very complicated chemical 
molecules can operate in 



humans to make them 
intelligent, then equally 
complicated electronic 
circuits can also make 
computers act in an 
intelligent way'.- Intelligent 
computers will then design 
even more intelligent and 
complex computers. - 

His new position was 
controversial, but it was 
largely forgotten in the wake 
of the 9/11 attacks. The 



interviews that inevitably 
followed - for the media felt 
confident that Stephen 
Hawking would have wise 
words to offer on other topics 
besides physics - gave him 
the opportunity to introduce 
another issue that he had been 
considering. He told an 
interviewer from the 
Guardian: 'although 
September 1 1 was horrible, it 
did not threaten the survival 



of the entire human race. The 
danger is that either by 
accident or design we may 
create a virus that destroys 
us.'- 6 

Hawking advised that 
plans be put in place as soon 
as possible with the long- 
range goal of colonizing 
space to ensure the survival 
of the human race. This was 
not an off-the-cuff notion, 
soon to be forgotten. Already 



in the millennial interview he 
had predicted a manned, 'or 
should I say personned', 
flight to Mars within the 
century. But that would be 
only the first stop. Mars isn't 
suitable for human habitation. 
We need either to learn to 
live in space stations or travel 
to the next star, and that 
journey he was sure would 
not happen within the 
century. Because we can't 



travel faster than light (no 
matter what science fiction 
claims), the trip would be 
slow, boring and arduous. 
Hawking would return to the 
advisability for humans to 
colonize space in the 
children's books he would 
write with his daughter Lucy 
a few years later. This need 
seemed urgent enough for 
him to try to ingrain it in the 
minds of children who would 



be setting the agenda in the 
future. 

Not everyone appreciated 
pronouncements like these 
about issues beyond his own 
field of expertise. Most of 
Hawking 's critics called him 
not 'wrong' but 'naive'. Sir 
Brian Pippard, an eminent 
twentieth-century physicist, 
once apologized for himself 
and his colleagues for being 
'inclined to believe that their 



expertise absolves them from 
the duty of studying other 
branches of knowledge before 
contributing their own 
penn'orth of wisdom'. - 
Hawking could perhaps be 
declared guilty, but he knew 
he had a golden opportunity 
to reach the public with ideas 
he strongly believes are 
important and ought to be 
heard. He possibly had 
enough clout to influence 



public policy. 



The TOE Revisited 

In his Lucasian inaugural 
lecture in 1980, Hawking had 
announced that the most 
promising candidate to unify 
the forces and particles was 
N=8 supergravity. In 1990 he 
had told me he suspected it 
might turn out to be 
superstrings, with his no- 
boundary proposal answering 



the question about the 
boundary conditions of the 
universe. Now, the close of 
the millennium had come and 
gone. Still no end to 
theoretical physics. Still no 
Theory of Everything. In 
April 2002, Hawking told a 
reporter that T still think 
there's a 50-50 chance that 
we will find a complete 
unified theory in the next 
twenty years'- - a much more 



modest and tentative forecast 
than he had made in his 
Lucasian Lecture. 

As the months passed, 
Hawking hedged his bets 
even more. He was 
reconsidering one of the main 
thrusts of his scientific career, 
beginning to suspect that the 
fundamental, unified theory - 
if it exists at all - is at a level 
that will never be accessible 
to us. Our understanding will 



always resemble a patchwork 
quilt, with different theories 
holding in different regions, 
agreeing only in certain 
overlapping areas. If this is 
the case, then it would be ill 
advised to view what seem 
like inconsistencies among 
the theories as a sign that they 
are weak or incorrect. What 
we would be able to discover 
about the universe would 
inevitably be something like a 



jigsaw puzzle in which it is 
not so difficult 'to identify 
and fit together the pieces 
around the edges' - 
supergravity and the different 
string theories - but in which 
we will never be able to 'have 
much idea what happens in 
the middle'.- In a lecture for 
the Paul Dirac Centennial 
Celebration at Cambridge, in 
July 2002, he said, 'Some 
people will be very 



disappointed if there is not an 
ultimate theory that can be 
formulated as a finite number 
of principles. I used to belong 
to that camp, but I have 
changed my mind.'— 

Hawking asked his 
audience to recall the 
Austrian mathematician Kurt 
Godel, who in 1931 had 
shown that mathematics was 
'incomplete' because in any 
mathematical system 



complex enough to include 
the addition and 

multiplication of whole 
numbers, there are 
propositions that can be 
stated - and that we can even 
see are true - but that cannot 
be proved or disproved 
mathematically within the 
system. Hawking thought that 
it might also be the case in 
physics that there are things 
that are true but cannot be 



proved. Kip Thorne had 
spoken about the change in 
Hawking 's way of working, 
from an insistence on 
rigorous mathematical proof 
to a quest not for certainty but 
for 'high probability and 
rapid movement towards the 
ultimate goal of 

understanding the nature of 
the universe'.- Hawking had 
made large intuitive leaps, 
expecting others to fill in the 



gaps he was leaving behind. 
Was he now about to become 
even more daring, warning 
his listeners that things he 
was sure are true would be 
impossible to prove? No, 
even he had to join the human 
race at the brink of a chasm 
that no one could cross. Our 
theories are inconsistent or 
incomplete, he said, because 
'we and our models are both 
part of the universe we are 



describing . . . Physical 
theories are self-referential.'— 
The new and still elusive 
candidate he spoke about in 
his Dirac Centennial lecture 
was not 'an ultimate theory 
that can be formulated as a 
finite number of principles', 
but it might be the best we 
could ever do. It was M- 
theory. A particularly 
interesting version of that 
theory incorporated the brane 



theory that Townsend had 
suggested. Recall from our 
discussion of p-branes that 
when p = 1, that is a string. 
So strings could now be 
considered members of the 
larger clan that Townsend 
had named p-branes. 
Hawking was not throwing 
supergravity and string 
theory, his two earlier 
favourite candidates for the 
Theory of Everything, out of 



the window by any means. 
The five most promising 
superstring theories could be 
grouped in a family of 
theories that would also 
include supergravity. The 
superstring theories and 
supergravity were the pieces 
of the 'patchwork quilt', 
useful for considering 
different situations, but none 
of them applied in all 
situations. The unexpected 



network of relationships that 
physicists had found among 
them had led to the suspicion 
that these theories are all 
actually different expressions 
of a deeper, underlying theory 
- M-theory - which did not, 
as yet, have a single 
formulation. Hawking had 
begun to think it never would. 

In the M-theory network 
of mathematical models, 
spacetime has a total of ten or 



eleven dimensions. These are 
usually taken to be nine or ten 
space dimensions and one 
time dimension. You may be 
wondering why no one ever 
thinks there might be more 
than one time dimension, so I 
should tell you that some 
versions of the theory do 
allow more time dimensions, 
as long as the total stays the 
same. 

We, of course, experience 



only four dimensions. Where 
are the others? Hawking 
himself commented in 2001: 
' I must say that personally I 
have been reluctant to believe 
in extra dimensions. But as I 
am a positivist, the question 
"Do extra dimensions really 
exist?" has no meaning. All 
one can ask is whether 
mathematical models with 
extra dimensions provide a 
good description of the 



universe. '- 

The proposed answer to 
the question of why we don't 
see them is that the extras are 
rolled up very small. Think of 
a garden hose. We know that 
a garden hose has thickness to 
it, but from a distance it looks 
like a line with length but no 
other dimension. If the extra 
dimensions were 'rolled up' 
like that we would miss 
noticing them, not only on 



human scales, but even on 
atomic or nuclear physics 
scales. 

Could we ever observe 
them? Suppose one or more 
of the extra dimensions is not 
so completely rolled up after 
all. That suggestion may be 
testable with a more 
advanced generation of 
particle accelerators or by 
measuring the gravitational 
force operating over 



extremely short distances. 

Meanwhile, M-theory and 
extra dimensions had staked 
out a claim in the future of 
theoretical physics and 
cosmology. That future 
would be the theme of a 
conference held to celebrate 
Hawking 's sixtieth birthday 
in 2002. 

Sixty or Bust! 

Hawking ' s sixtieth-birthday 



party almost didn't happen. 
He and his wheelchair ran 
into a wall a few days before 
the event. Hawking brushed 
this off in the opening of his 
lecture, 'Sixty Years in a 
Nutshell': 'It was nearly 
59.97 years in a nutshell. I 
had an argument with a wall a 
few days after Christmas, and 
the wall won. But 
Addenbrooke's Hospital did a 
very good job of putting me 



back together again. — 

There had been a moment 
when those planning the 
birthday party stopped dead 
and held their breath, but then 
it was learned that Hawking 
was working on his own 
birthday speech in his 
hospital bed. The 
preparations continued. No 
one had to cancel, at the last 
minute, the Marilyn Monroe 
impersonator who would 



fawn over Hawking and 
croon 6 I Want to be Loved By 
You' ... or tell all the physics 
luminaries gathering from 
around the world that they 
could come and give their 
talks, but the man they were 
celebrating would not be 
present. The party happened. 
Hawking thought sixty was 
well worth celebrating. Many 
people, he told interviewers, 
don't welcome turning sixty, 



but for him it was an 
accomplishment. He had 
never expected to live so 
long. 

It was a many-faceted 
celebration. A serious four- 
day 'fest schrift' conference 
featured high-level papers 
presented by giants of 
theoretical physics and 
cosmology whose work 
touched on Hawking' s. The 
public was admitted for a day 



of popular-level lectures. The 
real partying took place in the 
evening, attended by a crowd 
of as many as 200 guests. 
There was 'Marilyn', whom 
Hawking dubbed 'a model of 
the universe'. There was a 
choir of former and current 
graduate students and 
Hawking 's first wife Jane, 
conducted by her husband, 
Jonathan Hellyer Jones, and 
accompanied by the U2 



guitarist, Edge. Because 
Hawking 's birthday fell close 
to the church Feast of St 
Stephen, they sang 'Good 
King Wenceslas' with new 
words written by Bernard 
Carr. 'Page and Hawking, 
forth they went' referred to 
Don Page. At one of the 
parties, in the Hall of Caius, 
Martin Rees - by this time Sir 
Martin Rees, Astronomer 
Royal - spoke glowingly 



about his old friend. A party 
in the Hall of Trinity College 
featured a sudden burst of 
colour and music as can-can 
dancers made a spectacular 
entrance. Television crews 
from Channel 4, the BBC, 
and America's CBS were 
present, and there was a live 
webcast to the BBC's website 
of Hawking' s public lecture 
and the audience's rowdy, 
spontaneous, painfully off- 



key singing of 'Happy 
Birthday' that followed it - 
one of many renditions of it 
that week. The BBC later 
broadcast all the popular 
lectures as 'The Hawking 
Lectures'. 

Hawking ' s colleagues 
took advantage of the 
opportunity to rib him: 

Martin Rees: 
'Astronomers are used to 
large numbers, but few are as 



huge as the odds I would 
have offered then [when 
Hawking was a graduate 
student at Cambridge] against 
witnessing this marvellous 
celebration. '— 

Roger Penrose: 'I am very 
glad to note that Stephen has 
now also officially become an 
old man, so that he can also 
get away with saying such 
outrageous things. Of course 
Stephen has always done that 



kind of thing, but he can 
perhaps feel a little bolder in 
this even than before.'— 

Bernard Carr: 'I've often 
suspected that there must be 
more than one Stephen 
Hawking to have made so 
many important discoveries. I 
would like to wish all of them 
a very happy sixtieth 
birthday!' 1 - 7 

Leonard Susskind: 
'Stephen, as we all know, is 



by far the most stubborn and 
infuriating person in the 
universe.'— 

Raphael Bousso: 'It is a 
pleasure to help celebrate 
Stephen Hawking 's sixtieth 
birthday (not least because 
Stephen knows how to 
party). '- 

Gary Gibbons, praising 
' Stephen ' s indomitable 
courage and daring 
optimism',- quoted Robert 



Browning: 'Ah, but a man's 
reach should exceed his grasp 
or what's a heaven for?' 

Michael Green recalled 
the early 1970s in Cambridge, 
when he first met Stephen, 
and cosmology was held in 
such low regard that 'it was 
considered a sub-branch of 
astrology and was not 
discussed at all! 

Neil Turok spoke of 
Hawking 's 'real "lust for life" 



that keeps him going against 
all odds' A 2 

Kip Thome's birthday 
present was a promise that 
'gravitational wave detectors 
- LIGO, GEO, VIRGO and 
LISA - will test your Golden- 
Age black-hole predictions, 
and they will begin to do so 
well before your seventieth 
birthday'. 2 - 3 

The papers prepared for 
the sixtieth-birthday 



conference gave a splendid 
summing up of where things 
stood in theoretical physics 
and cosmology in 2002, and 
how they had got there, and, 
as the conference title 
suggested, provided a 
springboard for the future. It 
brought together the finest 
minds in the world on the 
topics that most interested 
Hawking and impinged on his 
own work, and also to a 



remarkable extent brought 
together the grey eminences 
of the field with energetic 
younger people who were 
going to carry it into the 
future, many of whom had 
been Hawking 's students. It 
all went on for a week . . . and 
why not? This was a birthday 
party no one for many of the 
sixty years had expected to 
attend. Elaine's birthday gift 
was a thirty-minute flight in a 



specially designed hot-air 
balloon. When Hawking had 
dreamed of such a flight at 
the time of his tracheotomy in 
1985, he had taken it as a 
symbol of hope. At the age of 
sixty, it seemed that this hope 
had been amply fulfilled. 

Hawking' s colleagues and 
others who shared his 
birthday celebration were 
willing to accept his brushing 
off his wheelchair accident as 



something trivial, but it was 
in truth more serious than 
that. Wheeling along the 
uneven old pavement of 
Malting Lane near his home, 
accompanied by a nurse, he 
had lost control and crashed 
his chair into a wall, turning 
the chair over and breaking 
his hip. Neel Shearer, his 
graduate assistant, shrugged: 
'He was late for an 
appointment and running on 



Hawking time, as ever.'— 
Hawking ' s weakened 
condition precluded the use 
of a general anaesthetic when 
the doctors repaired him. 
With only an epidural 
anaesthetic, Hawking 
experienced the whole 
procedure, something 'like 
hearing a Black and Decker 
drill'. ^ 

Hawking ' s sixtieth- 
birthday year saw the 



publication of his carefully 
chosen compilation of 
excerpts from the writings of 
Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, 
Newton and Einstein. On the 
Shoulders of Giants also 
featured biographical 
sketches of the five men and 
commentary by Hawking. 



Unpacking the 
CMBR 



As the new millennium got 
underway, a new generation 
of observers and 
observational instruments 
were gearing up to test the 
predictions made by inflation 
cosmology with 
unprecedented accuracy.- In 
a continued search for 
experimental evidence that 
might, or might not, support 
inflation predictions, attention 
focused, not surprisingly, on 



the CMBR, the afterglow of 
the Big Bang. George 
Smoot's discovery had shown 
that in the extraordinarily 
evenly dispersed microwave 
light, the temperature does 
vary from point to point. In 
1998 (results released in 
2000), balloon observations 
had measured the CMBR in 
detail in certain parts of the 
sky;- and in 2001 the 
ground-based Degree 



Angular Scale Interferometer 
at the South Pole took similar 
measurements. 

Then, in June 2001, 
NASA launched WMAP, the 
Wilkinson Microwave 
Anisotropy Probe.— Its 
mission: to map the CMBR 
more precisely than had ever 
before been possible. It was 
capable of measuring 
temperature differences 
varying by only a millionth of 



a degree and, because it was a 
satellite rather than a land- 
based instrument, take these 
measurements over the entire 
sky. The expectation was that 
WMAP would settle once and 
for all many of the arguments 
of the last few decades about 
the basic properties of the 
universe - its age, its shape, 
its expansion rate, its 
composition, its density. 
Different versions of inflation 



theory were telling slightly 
different stories about 
precisely how inflation 
happened and making 
predictions about what 
pattern of temperature 
variations we should find in 
the CMBR if we compare its 
temperature in different 
directions.^ WMAP data 
were expected to give 
scientists ways to test these 
different scenarios.- 



By February 2003, 
WMAP was brilliantly living 
up to its promise. Its data had 
allowed scientists to nail 
down precisely after many 
decades of controversy the 
age of the universe - 13.7 
billion years - as well as the 
time in the universe's history 
when patterns in the CMBR 
froze into place - 380,000 
years after the Big Bang. 
WMAP results showed that 



space is flat and supported 
those who were insisting that 
most of the energy in the 
universe today is 'dark 
energy'. WMAP 
measurements showed that 
the variations in temperature 
and density in the CMBR, 
observed across the sky - the 
variations that seeded the 
formation of galaxies - all 
had roughly the same 
amplitude regardless of their 



length, that all forms of 
energy had the same 
variation, and that the 
distribution of variations was 
random - just as predicted by 
the standard Big Bang 
inflationary model- 
Nevertheless, important 
issues remained unresolved 
by that first February 2003 
release of WMAP data. One 
key piece of evidence was 
missing: inflation theory 



makes predictions about what 
the patterns and 

characteristics of gravitational 
waves originating from the 
Big Bang should be like as 
they show up in the CMBR. 
WMAP had not yet found 
these gravitational wave 
footprints. Nor was it 
determined whether the dark 
energy was due to 'vacuum 
energy' - the cosmological 
constant - or 'quintessence'. 



Interestingly, the observations 
that were fitting well with 
inflationary cosmology also 
fit a cyclical model where the 
universe expands from a big 
bang, eventually contracts 
again to a big crunch, and 
then reemerges in another big 
bang, in a cycle that keeps 
repeating itself - models 
which Neil Turok and Roger 
Penrose were favouring.- 



Slowing down? 

Hawking made yet another 
excursion into popular culture 
in the spring of 2003 when he 
agreed to take part in a 
routine on Late Night with 
Conan O'Brien. Comedian 
Jim Carrey led off the sketch 
by discussing cosmology. A 
mobile phone rang. The caller 
was Stephen Hawking telling 
Carrey not to bother: 'Their 
pea brains cannot possibly 



grasp the concept.' Having 
said that, he quickly excused 
himself. He couldn't stay on 
the phone because he was 
watching Carrey's film Dumb 
and Dumber, stunned by the 
'pure genius of it'. Hawking 's 
travel schedule that year had 
him criss-crossing the world, 
from a month at the Mitchell 
Institute for Fundamental 
Physics at Texas A&M to a 
meeting on cosmic inflation 



at the University of 
California-Davis, to Sweden 
to receive the Oskar Klein 
Medal from the Royal 
Swedish Academy of 
Sciences and to attend a 
Nobel Symposium on String 
Theory and Cosmology, back 
to America for a two-month 
visit at Caltech and the 
University of California- 
Santa Barbara, then over to 
Case Western Reserve 



University in Cleveland. 

Unease among his physics 
colleagues that Stephen 
Hawking was slowing down 
seemed unfounded, given 
such a schedule, but they also 
feared he might be no longer 
at the height of his 
intellectual powers. In a poll 
taken among physicists at the 
end of the millennium asking 
who were the most influential 
physicists, Hawking 's name 



was not anywhere near the 
top. His use of the little 
'clicker' that responded to his 
faint hand pressure - the only 
way he could communicate 
with colleagues was 
becoming more and more 
difficult and slow. One way 
to get around this frustrating 
situation was to solicit the 
help of a research student. 
This time Hawking chose a 
young man named Christophe 



Galfard. The procedure 
would be for Hawking to 
consider a problem and 
suggest possible approaches 
to Galfard, who would then 
concentrate on the 
mathematical details to find 
out whether Hawking' s 
insights were correct and 
whether they led anywhere. 

Galfard recalls that it took 
a while for him to get up to 
steam. Hawking 's ideas were 



coming much more rapidly 
than he could deal with them. 
In words that are encouraging 
to anyone like myself who 
has read Hawking 's papers 
and laboured to understand 
them, Galfard has described 
his chagrin as each sentence 
seemed to take about six 
months to decipher. He was 
lagging behind a half year 
and catching up was tough 
going.- 



In the interest of moving 
things forward more rapidly, 
Galfard took a liberty that 
others had seldom taken - 
finishing sentences for 
Hawking when his intention 
was clear and he was 
struggling to select the words. 
In the past Hawking had often 
gone right ahead and 
completed the sentence, 
ignoring this second-guessing 
even when it was correct, but 



he allowed Galfard to 
expedite matters. Galfard also 
used Hawking 's ability to 
indicate 'yes' and 'no' with a 
small movement of his face, 
rather than wait for him to 
find the word on his screen. 
You wonder, seeing video 
clips of the two of them 
together, how Galfard 
avoided getting a bad crick in 
his neck as he bobbed back 
and forth between peering 



straight ahead at the computer 
screen and dipping forward to 
see Hawking 's face. 

Galfard had his work cut 
out for him. In 2003, a young 
Argentinian physicist named 
Juan Martin Maldacena, at 
the Institute for Advanced 
Studies in Princeton, finally 
gave Leonard Susskind's 
ideas for solving the 
information paradox a 
rigorous mathematical 



treatment that seemed to 
settle the issue in Susskind's 
favour.- At a conference in 
Santa Barbara, after-dinner 
speaker Jeff Harvey, instead 
of giving the expected talk, 
introduced a victory song. 
'The Maldacena' was set to 
the music of a Latin dance 
that was popular in the mid- 
1990s, the 'Macarena'. Each 
short verse ended with 'Ehhh! 
Maldacena! '— The audience 



enthusiastically joined in the 
singing and dancing, 
celebrating the rescue of 
physics from the ogre of the 
information paradox. 
Susskind declared the war 
over. It should have come to 
an end much earlier, he 
insisted, but Hawking 'was 
like one of those unfortunate 
soldiers who wander in the 
jungle for years, not knowing 
that the hostilities have 



ended' .— Although a 
consensus was indeed 
growing that Hawking was 
wrong, Kip Thorne stuck with 
him. Hawking did not change 
his mind. Not yet. 

He asked Galfard to study 
Maldacena's paper about the 
information paradox. 
Hawking had decided nothing 
would do but a frontal attack 
on this piece that was 
convincing people he was 



wrong. It was not an easy 
assignment. After messing 
with it for a year and a half, 
Galfard still found it difficult 
to decide whether information 
was or was not lost in black 
holes. 

On 1 December 2003, 
Hawking was rushed to the 
hospital with pneumonia. On 
life support for several weeks, 
while others feared he was 
probably on his deathbed, he 



didn't waste the time. He 
spent it thinking about black 
holes, intent on finding a 
fresh approach to the 
information paradox. 
Recovery was slow, but after 
his discharge in the late 
winter of 2004 he and Galfard 
began again in earnest 
discussing the ideas those 
bedridden months had 
produced. After many 
gruellingly long days and late 



nights, including weekends 
when the work seemed never 
to stop,- Hawking finally felt 
he was ready to emerge from 
the quiet refuge of his office 
and do battle. 

The Dublin 

Conference 

That spring of 2004, Hawking 
gave a seminar in Cambridge 
to introduce some of his new 



ideas in a preliminary, 
sketchy fashion, and he let it 
be known that he wished to 
address his physics 
colleagues at a major 
conference. There was just 
such an event coming up in 
July in Dublin, the 17th 
International Conference on 
General Relativity and 
Gravitation. Hawking 
contacted the Chair of the 
Scientific Committee of the 



conference, Curt Cutner, 
requesting a slot on the 
programme with the words 4 1 
have solved the black hole 
information problem and I 
want to talk about it.'- It was 
a big favour to request, for 
Hawking 's paper was a late 
entry - participants had been 
asked to submit a title and 
abstract by 19 March, when 
he was barely out of the 
hospital. Also he would not 



be releasing a preprint of the 
paper. Nevertheless, his 
stature in the field won him 
an hour-long slot on the 
conference schedule. 

The media and fan frenzy 
his appearance generated 
showed that Hawking' s 
superstar celebrity status had 
not waned. A public relations 
firm responsible for 
controlling access to the 
auditorium charged a reported 



£4,000, and it earned its fee 
as reporters and Hawking 
aficionados stormed the 
doors. Those fortunate 
enough to sport press badges 
soon lined the aisles inside, 
setting up their cameras and 
recording paraphernalia. 

There was less excitement 
among Hawking 's colleagues, 
rightfully in the hall as 
conference participants, as 
they wondered what to 



expect. Bursts of camera 
flashes followed Hawking as 
he made his smooth, stately, 
frozen progress along the 
aisle to the foot of a ramp that 
led to the stage of the grand 
concert hall of the Royal 
Dublin Society. Some 
believed he was about to 
deliver a defiant statement 
that would reiterate what he 
had been saying for more 
than twenty years, that 



information is lost in black 
holes. Others thought this 
fading genius would quietly 
concede the issue. Kip 
Thorne, who had continued 
through the years to agree 
with Hawking about the loss 
of information in black holes, 
John Preskill, who had not, 
Petros Florides, who chaired 
the conference, and 
Christophe Galfard were 
waiting on stage, facing an 



array of TV cameras ready to 
record the event. It was not a 
normal day at a physics 
conference. 

Only Galfard and Thorne 
knew that Hawking was 
about to make one of his 
famous about-faces, but not 
in the way anyone was 
expecting. He was not going 
to concede to Susskind and 
Maldacena. Yes, the idea he 
had stubbornly stuck with for 



more than twenty years was 
wrong. But Susskind and 
Maldacena hadn't solved the 
problem. Hawking would do 
that himself. He had thought 
of another way to get round 
the information paradox. 

The session began with an 
introduction by Petros 
Florides who quipped that 
while it is well known that no 
information can travel faster 
than the speed of light, this 



law seemed not to hold when 
it came to the speed at which 
the news of an upcoming 
Hawking appearance travels 
around the world. 

It had become Hawking 's 
custom to introduce his 
lectures with the question, in 
his calm, mechanical voice, 
'Can you hear me?' 
Presumably if you couldn't, 
you wouldn't answer, so there 
was usually either an 



agreeable murmur or a cheer 
in reply. After that trademark 
beginning, he began by laying 
out the problem and tracing 
the history of the information 
paradox all the way back to 
the mid-1960s, when it was 
discovered that all 
information about a body 
collapsing to form a black 
hole was lost from the outside 
region except for three things: 
mass, angular momentum and 



electric charge. John Wheeler 
called this discovery 'black 
holes have no hair', and it has 
been ever since known as the 
'no hair theorem'. 

None of this presented a 
problem for information 
conservation. A classical 
black hole would last for ever 
preserving the information 
inside it, inaccessible, but 
there. Still part of the 
universe. The problem had 



emerged when Hawking 
discovered that quantum 
effects would cause a black 
hole to radiate at a steady rate 
the famous Hawking 
radiation. That radiation 
carries no information about 
what made the black hole or 
what has fallen in. Still no 
problem until you realize that 
in this process the black hole 
would eventually evaporate 
away and disappear entirely. 



Then what would happen to 
all that information locked 
inside? It seemed the only 
way the information could 
avoid being lost would be if 
the Hawking radiation had 
subtle differences in it that 
would reflect what had fallen 
in. No one had found any way 
for such differences to be 
produced, though many 
physicists believed one must 
exist. Hawking 's calculations, 



however, showed that the 
radiation was exactly thermal, 
random and featureless. - 

In case anyone was 
wondering whether a baby 
universe branching off a 
black hole might solve the 
information loss problem, 
Hawking brought them up to 
date: 



There is no baby 
universe branching off 



inside a black hole, as 
I once thought. The 
information remains 
firmly in our universe. 
I'm sorry to 
disappoint science 
fiction fans, but if 
information is 
preserved, there is no 
possibility of using 
black holes to travel 
to other universes. If 
you jump into a black 



hole, your mass 
energy will be 
returned to our 
universe, but in a 
mangled form, which 
contains the 
information about 
what you were like, 
but in an 

unrecognizable state.— 



Some in the audience 
must have pricked up their 



ears at that. Was Hawking 
about to say that Hawking 
radiation could after all be the 
vehicle of escape and that, as 
in the description earlier 
about restoring a burned 
book, it might at least in 
principle be possible to 
recover from that radiation 
the information hidden in a 
black hole? 

Hawking 's new solution 
to the problem had to do with 



something else, the 
possibility that a black hole 
could have more than one 
geometry (topology) at the 
same time. Information 
would not be trapped because 
a true event horizon would 
not form. 

Christophe Galfard 
remembers that Hawking 's 
talk seemed to leave most of 
his physics audience 'largely 
bemused'. There were 



whispers of 'big on claims, 
short on mathematics ... not 
really all that convincing ... 
mostly smoke and mirrors'. 
Kip Thorne commented: 
'This looks to me on the face 
of it to be a lovely argument, 
but I haven't yet seen all the 
details.'- He said he would 
have to take some time with 
Hawking 's paper before he 
could say whether or not 
Hawking was right. Roger 



Penrose was not convinced: 
'It seems to me that the 
indication that the 
information is lost is very 
powerful, and that is what 
Stephen originally thought. In 
Dublin he publicly retracted. 
In my view he was 
completely wrong to retract. 
He should have stuck to his 
guns.'- Hawking, though he 
expressed intentions of trying 
to support his idea with a 



mathematical proof, was 
convinced enough of his 
conclusions to concede a bet 
that he and Kip Thorne had 
made with John Preskill of 
Caltech. The bet read as 
follows: 

Whereas Stephen 
Hawking and Kip 
Thorne firmly believe 
that information 
swallowed by a black 



hole is for ever hidden 
from the outside 
universe, and can 
never be revealed 
even as the black hole 
evaporates and 
completely 
disappears, 

And whereas John 
Preskill firmly 
believes that a 
mechanism for the 
information to be 



released by the 
evaporating black 
hole must and will be 
found in the correct 
theory of quantum 
gravity, 

Therefore Preskill 
offers, and 
Hawking/Thorne 
accept, a wager that: 

When an initial 
pure quantum state 
undergoes 



gravitational collapse 
to form a black hole, 
the final state at the 
end of black hole 
evaporation will 
always be a pure 
quantum state. 

The loser(s) will 
reward the winner(s) 
with an encyclopedia 
of the winner's 
choice, from which 
information can be 



recovered at will. 

The document had been 
signed by all three men, 
Stephen Hawking 's signature 
being his thumbprint, and 
dated 6 February 1997, 
Pasadena, California. 

Hawking ended his talk 
saying, ' I will give John 
Preskill the encyclopedia he 
has requested. John is ail- 
American, so naturally he 



wants an encyclopedia of 
baseball. I had great difficulty 
in finding one over here, so I 
offered him an encyclopedia 
of cricket, as an alternative, 
but John wouldn't be 
persuaded of the superiority 
of cricket. Fortunately, my 
assistant, Andrew Dunn, 
persuaded the publishers 
Sportclassic Books to fly a 
copy of "Total Baseball: The 
Ultimate Baseball 



Encyclopedia" to Dublin. I 
will give John the 
encyclopedia now. If Kip 
agrees to concede the bet 
later, he can pay me back.' 
Thorne was not convinced 
that Hawking, or anyone else, 
had solved the problem of the 
information paradox. The 
encyclopedia was brought on 
stage, and John Preskill held 
it over his head as though he 
were holding the men's tennis 



championship trophy at 
Wimbledon. 

Hawking later 
commented on the occasion 
in a lecture he gave at Caltech 
the following January, in 
2005: The [information loss] 
paradox had been argued for 
thirty years without much 
progress until I found what I 
think was its resolution. 
Information is not lost, but it 
is not returned in a useful 



way. It is like burning an 
encyclopedia. Information is 
not lost, but it is very hard to 
read. I gave John Preskill a 
baseball encyclopedia. Maybe 
I should have just given him 
the ashes. '— 

Hawking had promised to 
provide his colleagues with a 
fuller explanation. It would 
take the form of a paper 
published in October 2005. 



fnl WMAP was the result of 
a partnership between the 
Goddard Space Flight Center 
and Princeton University.

'Grandad has wheels' 



THE BBC DEBUTED the 

Television film Hawking in 
April 2004, when Hawking 
had recently emerged from 
hospital and was preparing to 
do battle on the information 
paradox issue. This was not a 



full biography but a moving 
dramatization of two crucial 
years in Hawking 's life when 
he learned he had ALS, met 
Jane Wilde, and worked on 
singularity theorems for his 
thesis. A 2002 documentary, 
Stephen Hawking: Profile, 
was re-aired with the film. 
There were an estimated 4 
million viewers. 

Hawking helped with the 
final script, and Benedict 



Cumberbatch, who played 
young Stephen Hawking, 
took the trouble to study 
carefully the early stages of 
ALS. Jane, on whose 
autobiography the film was 
partially based, watched the 
video at first in bits and could 
find little to fault. 
' [Cumberbatch] was uncanny. 
He worked so hard in 
researching the exact 
progression of motor neurone 



disease. It brought back that 
period so very strongly. I 
think the young lady playing 
me, however, was much more 
feisty than ever I was. I was 
always extremely determined 
but I was also quite timid. So 
in that sense many of the 
things that appear in the film 
are not quite historically 
accurate.' However, Jane felt 
that the film was true to the 
spirit of those years. ' I can 



remember vividly the 
euphoric sense we had about 
us, that we were doing 
something exceptional 
that, despite it all, everything 
was going to be possible.' 1 

At about the same time 
the film was aired, the 
disturbing reports and 
statements having to do with 
abuse were finally locked 
away in the Cambridge police 
files. 



Hawking was not doing 
any less well in popularity 
polls. In a 2004 survey of role 
models that polled five 
hundred sixteen- to eighteen- 
year-old English boys, he 
came in second to rugby star 
Jonny Wilkinson, edged out 
again by a sports celebrity, as 
he had been in Japan. But 
Hawking was not slowing 
down as a world traveller and 
lecturer. His diary in 2005 



read: January: Caltech and 
the University of California- 
Santa Barbara; February: 
Washington, DC, and Oxford; 
March: Spain; June: Hong 
Kong; October: Germany; 
November: California again 
and then Seattle, Washington. 

During the January visit 
to Caltech, Hawking 
suggested that this time he 
give a lecture solely for 
undergraduates. The subject 



would be his life in physics. 
The title borrowed the 
famous Star Trek split 
infinitive: 'To Boldly Go'. 

The trip to Washington, 
DC, in February, with his 
wife Elaine, was for the 
purpose of receiving the 
James Smithson Bicentennial 
Medal. The Smithsonian 
Institution arranged, with 
help from Jim Hartle, to 
present a retrospective of 



Hawking 's life: 'Stephen 
Hawking ' s Alternate 
Universe'. Hartle introduced 
his old friend in glowing 
terms : ' Stephen Hawking ' s 
work has been characterized 
by great mathematical 
precision and extraordinary 
physical inventiveness. He is 
almost always surprising. '- 
Hartle quoted Hawking 's 
words about the career path 
he had followed: 'You might 



think I had a grand 
premeditated design to 
address the outstanding 
problems concerning the 
origin and evolution of the 
universe. But it was not really 
like that. I did not have a 
master plan. Rather I 
followed my nose and did 
whatever looked interesting 
and possible at the time.'- 

Hawking returned on this 
occasion to the possibility of 



extraterrestrial intelligent life, 
and his lecture was 
introduced by music that was 
clearly meant to resemble the 
sound track of Star Wars. 'By 
intelligent life, I don't mean 
only the DNA-based 
humanoid life like you see on 
Star Trek,' he said, 'which all 
is remarkably like ourselves. 
The range of possible life 
forms in the universe is much 
wider and includes electronic 



systems like computers.'- He 
criticized the Star Trek image 
of alien civilizations as too 
static. Even though the 
suggestion was that their 
science and technology are 
more advanced than ours at 
present, some of the alien 
beings are pictured as having 
attained a stable state near 
perfection, with no further 
progress or evolution 
expected. ' I don't believe the 



Star Trek picture. We will 
never reach a final steady 
state, the end of development. 
Instead we shall continue to 
change at an ever-increasing 
rate.'- 

The Oxford visit was to 
deliver the third lecture in a 
series honouring his old 
mentor, Dennis Sciama. In 
Oviedo, Spain, he helped to 
celebrate the twenty-fifth 
anniversary of the Prince of 



Asturias awards, which are 
major global awards for 
scientific, technical, cultural, 
social and humanitarian work 
done at an international level. 

All this travel and activity 
would seem enough to 
exhaust the fittest of men. For 
Hawking, even after passing 
his sixtieth birthday, it was 
apparently exhilarating, and, 
despite all the moving about, 
Hawking 's work as a popular 



author continued. October 
2005 saw the publication of 
another version of his first 
bestseller, this one titled A 
Briefer History of Time and 
co-authored with physicist 
Leonard Mlodinow. It was 
indeed briefer, beautifully 
illustrated and simpler, and 
brought the physics up to 
date. Also that year he began 
work compiling a collection 
of historical mathematical 



works with short biographies 
of important mathematicians, 
to be published in 2006. It 
would be titled God Created 
the Integers. 

Here and there, as 
Hawking lectured and met the 
media, he went on making 
provocative comments that 
had little or nothing to do 
with cosmology. His low 
opinion of politicians was 
increasingly evident. At an 



antiwar rally in Trafalgar 
Square in November 2004, he 
called the USA invasion of 
Iraq in March 2003 a 
'warcrime'.- In 2005, when 
George W. Bush suggested 
returning astronauts to the 
moon, Hawking commented 
that 'sending politicians 
would be much cheaper, 
because you don't have to 
bring them back'. 1 He 
admonished those who 



opposed stem cell research: 
'The fact that the cells may 
come from embryos is not an 
objection because the 
embryos are going to die 
anyway. It is morally 
equivalent to taking a heart 
transplant from a victim of a 
car accident. 

In May 2005 he lightened 
up - The Simpsons again. 
This time, an episode titled 
'Don't Fear the Roofer' had 



the 'Hawking' character 
announcing that he was now a 
Springfield resident. He had 
purchased the pizza parlor. 
He tried to get his computer 
to say the company motto but 
his computer got stuck and 
kept saying 'pizza pizza'. 
'Hawking' had to hit his 
computer to make it behave, 
something he cannot do in 
real life. Later in the story, 
'Hawking' saved Homer's 



sanity (if that is not an 
oxymoron) by explaining that 
it was a tear in spacetime and 
a little black hole, resulting in 
gravitational lensing, that 
caused Homer to be the only 
one able to see one of the 
other characters in Builder's 
Barn. Hawking also made a 
television appearance that 
year in the docudrama Alien 
Planet, as an expert 
consultant. 



On 22 August 2005, the 
long-awaited paper that 
Hawking had been promising 
would lay out clearly and in 
detail his solution to the 
information paradox finally 
went to Physical Review, who 
published it in their 18 
October edition. The paper 
was only three and a half 
pages long, with only three 
equations. Hawking utilized 
Feynman's sums-over- 



histories, applying them, as 
he had before, to the universe. 
In developing his no- 
boundary proposal with 
James Hartle, Hawking had 
studied different histories the 
universe could have had, and 
calculated which were more 
probable than others. Now he 
was likewise asking his 
readers to imagine all 
alternative histories of 
universes. Some would have 



black holes and some would 
not. Information would be 
lost in those histories with 
black holes, but not in those 
without black holes. His 
solution depended on the fact 
that the universe histories 
where black holes exist 
would be cancelled out by 
those where they do not, the 
upshot being that information 
wouldn't disappear because 
there would be no black holes 



for it to become trapped in in 
the first place. If you waited 
long enough, only those 
histories without black holes 
would be significant. 
Information, in the end, 
would be preserved. 

Given Hawking 's two 
explanations, and an earlier 
firm rejection of the idea that 
the information would be 
returned via Hawking 
radiation, it is a surprise to 



find that not long after he 
published this paper, in one 
of the children's books he 
wrote with his daughter Lucy 
- George 's Secret Key to the 
Universe- - with Christophe 
Galfard's name also on the 
title page, he used a 
completely different solution 
to the problem, a solution that 
did involve Hawking 
radiation. It is also intriguing 
to discover that his top-down 



approach, which we will 
discuss a little later, is not 
easy to reconcile with his 
2005 solution. Many of 
Hawking ' s colleagues 
remained unconvinced, 
wondering why he preferred 
his solution to Leonard 
Susskind's and Maldacena's. 
Perhaps the reason was that, 
having introduced the 
problem in the first place, he 
felt that he should be the one 



to solve it. 

Hawking and Galfard 
explained the delay of the 
paper on the grounds of 
Hawking ' s increasing 
difficulty with his hand-held 
clicker device. In that regard, 
2005 was a dispiriting year. 
The speed at which he could 
communicate had been 
slowing down since 2000 
until finally his hands were 
too weak to use the clicker. 



He exchanged it for a 
switching device attached to 
his glasses, developed by 
Words+ (the 
Infrared/Sound/Touch (1ST) 
switch). The low-power 
infrared beam can be 
controlled by the blink of an 
eye or by moving a cheek 
muscle. As of 2011, Hawking 
controls his with his cheek 
muscle. 

The 2005 travel schedule 



did not end as planned. His 
schedule may have read 
Seattle, but he didn't get 
there. He was to travel to 
Seattle from Oakland, 
California, but while he was 
being taken off his respirator 
in the morning shortly before 
departing from Oakland, 
something went wrong and 
Hawking 'basically flat-lined. 
They had to resuscitate him, 
and that panicked a few 



people. But he's been there 
before.'- Hawking stayed in 
Oakland and delivered the 
Seattle address by live 
telecast. 

Undaunted by that glitch, 
Hawking in 2006 scheduled 
travel to France, Spain, China 
and Israel. It was not his first 
time in Israel. He and Jane 
had been there to accept the 
Wolf Prize in 1988. But this 
time he refused to accept the 



invitation unless he could 
spend part of his visit with 
and lecture to Palestinians. 
That was arranged. In Israel 
he added a new quip to his 
long list, commenting that the 
lack of anonymity when 
travelling was a down side to 
celebrity and worse for him 
than for others: 'It is not 
enough for me to wear dark 
sunglasses and a wig. The 
wheelchair gives me away.'- 



The prestigious Copley 
Medal that he received from 
the Royal Society in 
November had travelled even 
further than its recipient. The 
Royal Society arranged for 
British astronaut Piers Sellers 
to fly it into space before 
presenting it to Hawking. 

Hawking 's marriage to 
Elaine ended in divorce in the 
summer of 2006. Hawking 
refrained from comment and 



his personal assistant, Judith 
Croasdell, brushed off 
reporters clamouring for a 
statement with the words 'He 
is far too busy. This is just a 
distraction which is really 
annoying. We don't have any 
time for any of this ... We 
have no interest in any of the 
gossip that is going on.'— 

While observations by 
WMAP continued and 
theorists looked forward to 



results that would help them 
understand inflation theory 
and settle other questions, 
they didn't stop in their tracks 
to wait. There were new 
models of inflation that went 
beyond the familiar four 
dimensions of our universe. 
In 2000, Hawking had 
mentioned the possible role 
of p-branes in inflation. Alan 
Guth, the founding father of 
inflation theory, was also 



studying the possibility of 
inflation in 'brane world' 
models. Natalia Shuhmaher 
and Robert Brandenberger of 
McGill University in 
Montreal came up with a 
model in 2006 in which it 
was a hot gas of branes that 
drove inflation. Their model 
had all the spatial dimensions 
starting out extremely 
compact, with the extra 
dimensions beyond our 



familiar three tucked together 
in what is called an 
'orbifold'. In the very early 
universe, the brane gas 
expanded and its energy 
density decreased until the 
three familiar spatial 
dimensions experienced an 
inflationary period.- 

Hawking stayed on in the 
large, comfortable house that 
he and his second wife had 
built together. For the first 



time since the beginning of 
his first marriage, he was 
living on his own, though of 
course still with nurses in 
attendance. He had resumed 
close contact with Jane and 
their children and 
grandchildren, relationships 
that had suffered over the past 
decade and a half, especially 
during the unpleasant period 
of the abuse issues when he 
had declined to honour their 



concerns. All seemed to have 
chosen to put behind them 
that difficult-to-understand 
chapter in their lives. 

Fat and Lean Years 
at the Trough 

Although string theorist Brian 
Greene would tell a 
Cambridge lecture audience 
in 2011 that string theorists 
were 'happy as pigs in shit', it 



had not always been like that. 
In the years leading up to his 
remark, beginning in the 
previous century, the pigsty 
had not always looked so 
appealing. As early as 1986, 
it had become clear to string 
theorists that the number of 
different ways the extra 
dimensions could curl up was 
distressingly enormous,- and 
this was considered a serious 
shortcoming of string theory. 



However, that same year 
Andrei Linde cheered up his 
fellow theorists by insisting, 
in his first paper about eternal 
inflation, that this multiplicity 
of types of compactification 
(curling up) 'should be 
considered not as a difficulty 
but as a virtue of these 
theories, since it increases the 
probability of the existence of 
mini-universes in which life 
of our type may appear.'- 



A happy moment came in 
1997 when Maldacena, then 
at Harvard, introduced an 
idea known as ADS-CFT— 
duality that suggested a link 
between conventional 
quantum field theory and a 
certain type of string theory. 
Recall that dualities are 
situations where two very 
different theories (sometimes 
seemingly contradictory) both 
accurately describe the same 



thing. Maldacena's idea was 
an unproved conjecture, but it 
promised eventually to 
provide a genuine mathematic 
basis for string theory, and 
for that reason it had a strong 
influence on string theory's 
subsequent development. 
'ADS-CFT correspondence' 
also had significant 
implications for the 
relationship between string 
theory and brane worlds,- 



and Hawking thought the idea 
had something to offer with 
regard to the information 
paradox, weighing in on the 
side of no loss of 
information.— 

Then, another downer. In 
2000, Joe Polchinski at the 
University of California- 
Santa Barbara and Raphael 
Bousso at the University of 
California-Berkeley found 
that the basic equations of 



string theory had a truly 
astronomical number of 
different possible solutions, 
each representing a different 
way to describe a universe. It 
was a while before anyone 
could figure out whether any 
of these solutions were stable, 
but that was settled in 2003. 
There are (very roughly) 10 500 
of them. The problem this 
huge number presented was 
that string theory could never 



be proved right or wrong. 
Almost any experimental 
result would be consistent 
with it. As you will recall 
from Chapter 2 . this is not 
good news for a theory. 

Again it was Andrei 
Linde who saved the day by 
pointing out that this was not 
such terrible news after all. 
Eternal inflation theory was, 
in fact, predicting just such a 
situation. 



Let's take a look first at 
the curling problem ... or 
non-problem. 

Curling Becomes an 
Olympic Event 

When a new universe 
emerges, not all the space 
dimensions predicted by 
string theory inflate. Some 
remain invisible but play an 
important role in deciding 



what form the new universe 
takes. Theorists were finding 
that they are not just curled 
up willy-nilly. Precisely how 
they are curled determines the 
apparent laws of nature in 
that particular universe. 

In the late 1980s and early 
1990s, when Hawking had 
been thinking about 
wormholes and baby 
universes, he had speculated 
that the masses of particles 



and other fundamental 
numbers in nature might not 
be fundamental to the totality 
of universes, but different for 
different universes. They 
might be 'quantum variables' 
- numbers fixed at random at 
the moment of creation in 
each universe. A throw of the 
dice, with no way to know 
from a theory how the dice 
would fall. 

In M-theory, it was no 



longer a dice throw. As 
Hawking and Mlodinow 
would put it in The Grand 
Design, 'the exact shape of 
the internal space determines 
both the values of physical 
constants, such as the charge 
of the electron, and the nature 
of the interactions between 
elementary particles'.— In 
other words, the fundamental 
laws of M-theory permit 
different laws of nature in 



different universes, in the 
way that the Constitution of 
the USA permits different 
local laws in the different 
states. What the local laws of 
nature are in a universe is 
determined by the way the 
extra dimensions are curled 
up. 

Linde and his colleagues 
calculated the different ways 
the extra dimensions could 
curl up, each way leading to a 



unique universe.- The 
number is enormous beyond 
imagining. Curling had 
indeed become an Olympic 
sport. The prosaic word 
'multiverse' fails dismally as 
the name for all this. It's too 
bad John Wheeler isn't still 
around to give it a better one. 



Top Down 

Earlier in the decade, 
Hawking and Turok had left 



the pea instanton lying on a 
shelf and each headed off in a 
different direction. Turok 
began to favour 'cyclic' 
models where the universe 
expands from a big bang, 
eventually contracts again to 
a big crunch, and then 
reemerges in another big 
bang, in a cycle that keeps 
repeating itself. 

Hawking was more 
interested in models of 



eternal inflation. The fact that 
there are perhaps infinite 
possibilities for types of 
universes in this model makes 
it difficult, some would argue 
impossible, to calculate the 
likelihood of one kind of 
universe over another. 
Undeterred by this sticky 
mathematical problem, 
Hawking was determined to 
try, and in doing so he was 
going to utilize something 



that was still controversial 
among some of his 
colleagues, the anthropic 
principle. 

The controversy over the 
use of the anthropic principle, 
which had come to a head 
when Hawking and Turok 
introduced their pea instanton 
theory, had not died away. 
However, Hawking 's old 
friend Martin J. Rees and 
Mario Livio had given the 



anthropic principle and its use 
added respectability when 
they wrote in a paper in 2005 
that "'anthropic reasoning" 
not only has a role in valid 
speculative scientific 
discourse, but may in fact 
have predictive power for 
sorting out allowable 
cosmological scenarios'. 
Although 'such arguments 
raise the blood pressure of 
many scientists ... it can 



indeed be one of many tools 
in the cosmological toolkit'.— 
Hawking was preparing to 
treat it as a powerful tool. 

In February 2006, he and 
Thomas Hertog collaborated 
on a paper reporting on work 
in which they combined the 
string landscape of multiple 
universes with the initial 
conditions of the no-boundary 
proposal. Their suggestion 
was that we picture the early 



universe as a superposition of 
all possible ways it could 
have existed in the string 
theory landscape - as you 
might, if you were about to 
draw a card from an 
unusually large deck, 
visualize all the possibilities 
of your draw at once. Each 
possibility produces a 
different future. We are faced 
with a universe that has 
many, many possible 



beginnings and many, many 
possible histories. As 
Hawking quipped in a lecture 
at Caltech that year, 'There 
will be a history in which the 
moon is made of blue cheese, 
but the amplitude for that is 
low, which is bad news for 
mice. — 

Hawking and Hertog 
confined themselves to a 
model with a simple 
landscape that permitted 



several different inflationary 
histories for the universe. 
Should you place yourself at 
'the beginning' and start 
calculating the probabilities 
of those universes emerging? 
No. In Hawking 's 'top-down' 
approach you start with the 
present, observing the 
universe as it currently exists, 
and then work backwards and 
decide how likely it is that 
each initial state would allow 



for the later existence of the 
populated universe we know. 
In this way, the present state 
of the universe 'selects' the 
past. 

Hawking and Hertog 
studied the observational 
consequences of the no- 
boundary initial conditions 
and came up with a scheme to 
test their theory. If this is a 
valid way of working, there 
will be subtle differences in 



the CMBR and the gravity 
wave spectra from what these 
would be like if standard 
inflation theory is correct. 
Future technology, Hawking 
thought, might be able to 
discover these subtleties.— 

Hawking delivered his 
2006 lecture at Caltech 
controlling his computer with 
his cheek muscle. Titled 'The 
Origins of the Universe', it 
included some of the new 



thinking he and Hertog had 
been doing. Hawking would 
describe their top-down 
approach more fully later in 
his book The Grand Design. 

Secret Keys and 
Cosmic Adventures 

When Lucy Hawking 's novel 
Jaded had appeared in the 
spring of 2004, and she'd 
begun a second one, The 



Accidental Marathon, she'd 
talked with many 
interviewers about her books. 
Lucy was not terribly 
surprised but somewhat 
annoyed that questions about 
her and her writing inevitably 
drifted into questions about 
her father. 

Lucy's life had taken a 
difficult turn. Her marriage 
had been shortlived, and soon 
after the separation her son 



William had been diagnosed 
with autism. 'I actually felt as 
if my heart was breaking into 
tiny pieces,' she said.- Her 
mother Jane had insisted she 
persevere in finding the most 
effective treatment possible. 
William, as a result, had done 
remarkably well. He was very 
proud of his grandfather, not 
so much because of his 
physics accomplishments, but 
because 'grandad has 



wheels'. And Hawking 
returned the compliment. His 
office was full of William's 
pictures, and he even 
included one photo in The 
Universe in a Nutshell. 

Lucy's response when the 
interviewers proved more 
interested in her father than in 
her was a practical one. She 
decided, if you can't beat 
'em, join 'em. She would 
collaborate on a book with 



him. 

In June 2006, Lucy 
accompanied her father on a 
trip to Hong Kong and 
Beijing, where the welcome 
was even more riotous than 
usual. When they appeared 
from their plane, police had 
to form a body chain to make 
a human corridor, holding 
back the crowds, so that they 
could reach the lift and get 
away to their hotel. Even with 



all that effort to protect him, 
Hawking came near to being 
pushed over. He was 
unflappable. He wanted to be 
photographed with this 
'rugby scrum' of excited 
students, but the front-page 
newspaper photos captured 
only him and the rather 
desperate-looking policemen, 
until things settled down 
enough for a picture with a 
well-behaved group of small 



school children, unfurling a 
welcoming banner larger than 
they were. Two physics 
undergraduates from the 
Hong Kong University of 
Science and Technology, 
where Hawking was 
scheduled to lecture, had the 
honour of presenting him 
with flowers. Paul Chu 
Ching-wu, the university's 
president, commented, 'He's 
one of the most famous 



scientists ever. If you could 
say that Isaac Newton 
changed the world, then 
Stephen Hawking has 
changed the universe. '— 

Stephen and Lucy 
Hawking took the opportunity 
of this well-publicized trip to 
announce that they would be 
co-authoring a children's 
book. George 's Secret Key to 
the Universe was the first of 
their books together. It 



featured not only the space 
adventures of its young hero 
George and his next-door 
neighbours, the scientist Eric 
and his daughter Annie, and 
Cosmos, a supercomputer, 
but also some of the other 
issues that concerned 
Hawking. Confronted with 
the pollution in Chinese 
cities, he had expressed his 
worry that Earth might 'end 
up like Venus, at 250 degrees 



centigrade and raining 
sulphuric acid' .— 

In the 'George' books, 
Lucy actually did give people 
like the interviewers who had 
annoyed her something of 
what they had been hoping 
for. George's Key to the 
Universe and George 's 
Cosmic Treasure Hunt,— the 
first two in what we may 
hope will be a series, are 
delightful and instructive, and 



also offer an insight into the 
personalities and lives of 
Hawking and his family. The 
physicist Eric is unmistakably 
Hawking, imagined without 
his disability. His passion for 
physics and insistence on 
sharing it, his insatiable 
curiosity, his single-minded 
devotion to his work, his love 
of children - all are there. I 
am told that the wonderful, 
redoubtable character, 



George's grandmother Mabel, 
with her selective deafness, is 
recognizably a portrait of 
Hawking 's mother Isobel. 
When George finds himself at 
a high-level physics 
conference and dares to raise 
his hand and ask a question, it 
is a retelling of a Hawking 
family story: when Robert, 
Lucy's older brother, was 
eight years old, he went with 
his father to a conference of 



theoretical physicists. He 
took a seat in the front row 
and listened intently, nodding 
his head, then raised his hand 
to ask an intelligent question. 
The description of the 
thoughtful, serious way the 
physicists in the book treat 
George's question is a tribute 
to Hawking 's real-life 
colleagues. The science in the 
books is Hawking 's science: 
black holes, Hawking 



radiation, the information 
paradox, the search for 
another planet for humans to 
colonize. 

Lucy told interviewers 
that there were several 
reasons for writing the 
'George' books. Her own son 
was ten years old, and she 
had a nephew as well, 
Robert's and his wife 
Katrina's son George. 
George's Secret Key to the 



Universe was dedicated to 
him and William. Lucy 
wanted to create, with her 
father, a book that would 
explain for these children 
some of the work he had 
done. She had noticed the 
interest when children and 
their parents had gathered 
around her father at 
William's birthday parties, 
amazed that he was willing to 
answer their questions and 



explain his science to them. 
She had watched him take the 
time and trouble to give them 
good, thoughtful, informative 
answers and also make them 
laugh. Hawking pointed out 
that as children most of us 
start out filled with curiosity 
and wonder. Anything is 
possible. That hasn't changed 
for him. That's still the way 
he feels, and he and Lucy 
want to encourage that 



feeling in their young readers. 

Working with her father 
on the book gave Lucy a 
chance to see what her father 
was like at work in his own 
field, and that, she said, 
altered their relationship. 
Though she doesn't think he 
has changed much - possibly 
mellowed - she had never 
had the opportunity to see this 
side of him. 'He has the 
amazing ability to hold 



enormous amounts of 
information in his head, but 
also to pick out relevant 
details and make brief 
comments, which can 
completely transform your 
way of thinking.'- She was 
awed by how quick and clear- 
minded he is, and the knack 
he has for putting things 
together and having them fit. 

In November 2006 
Hawking was once again 



stressing, in a BBC radio 
interview, that the future of 
the human race depends on 
our colonizing another planet, 
not in our solar system but 
orbiting another star.- He had 
hopes of going into space 
himself. A month earlier 
Hawking had mentioned in an 
interview that his next goal 
was to go on a space flight 
and 'Maybe Richard Branson 
will help me' - which 



Branson wasted no time 
before offering to do. There 
would be a place for him in 
2010 on Branson's sub- 
orbital space flight venture 
Virgin Galactic. Paris Hilton 
and William Shatner would 
go along. Hawking didn't 
expect Branson to get him to 
another habitable planet, but 
was sure the future could hold 
such journeys, and the 
fictional characters in his and 



Lucy's books followed up on 
just that suggestion. 

Later in 2006, twenty-five 
thousand people responded in 
a blog with answers to 
Hawking 's question, 'In a 
world that is in chaos 
politically, socially and 
environmentally, how can the 
human race sustain another 
100 years?' No wonder he 
was thinking his ideas might 
actually influence public 



policy! In his posted follow- 
up to the blog, he mentioned 
genetic engineering, this time 
not as something perhaps 
undesirable that was going to 
happen anyway, but with the 
Utopian hope that it might 
make human beings 'wise 
and less aggressive '.— 

On the trip to China with 
Lucy, Hawking had once 
again joked about Pope John 
Paul IPs forbidding scientists 



to study the origin of the 
universe, and said he was 
glad the Pope was unaware of 
the topic of his talk because 
he 'didn't fancy the thought 
of being handed over to the 
Inquisition like Galileo'. The 
Vatican itself seemed able to 
overlook comments like that, 
but Catholic lay leaders had 
heard the misquotation and 
flippant remark once too 
often. In a heated response, 



Catholic League president 
Bill Donohue said that 
Hawking 'should stop 
distorting the words of the 
pope': 'There is a 
monumental difference 
between saying that there are 
certain questions that science 
cannot answer - which is 
what the pope said - and 
authoritarian pronouncements 
warning scientists to back 
off.'— The Pope's statement 



had, as we have seen, not 
been an inaccurate 
description of the state of 
scientific knowledge at the 
time he made it, and there 
was no threat to make anyone 
fear Galileo's fate. His words 
were: 

Every scientific 
hypothesis about the 
origin of the world . . . 
leaves unanswered the 



problem concerning 
the beginning of the 
universe. By itself 
science cannot resolve 
such a question: it 
requires human 
knowledge which 
rises above the 
physical, the 
astrophysical, what 
we call the 
metaphysical; what is 
required above all is 



the knowledge which 
comes from the 
revelation of GocL- 



Hawking took Catholic 
League president Bill 
Donohue's words to heart. On 
his visits to the Vatican as a 
member of the Pontifical 
Academy, he has not 
mentioned the incident or 
Galileo again. Pope John Paul 
II had acknowledged in a 



speech in 1992 that the 
Roman Catholic Church had 
erred in condemning Galileo, 
an acknowledgement 
Hawking had said he hoped 
would eventually be made, 
when he visited the Vatican 
in 1973. It was time to bury 
the hatchet. 

Zero Gravity 

In April 2007, Hawking 
undertook an adventure that 



he hoped would be the first 
step on the road to a real 
space flight. This was a flight 
that offers passengers the 
experience of weightlessness, 
zero gravity. No one was 
certain how his frail body 
would react. No problem! 
Hawking took eight turns of 
weightlessness, four minutes 
in all, more than anyone had 
expected, except, perhaps, 
himself. ' I could have gone 



on and on!' he said.- Four 
physicians and two nurses, 
who monitored Hawking 's 
blood pressure, cardiac 
readings and blood oxygen 
levels throughout the flight, 
agreed. 

A company called 'Zero 
Gravity' provides these 
flights. Here's how it works: 
The plane follows a 
parabolic, rollercoaster path. 
As the plane climbs, 



passengers feel almost twice 
the pull of gravity they 
normally feel on Earth. Near 
the top of the parabola, they 
feel they are in free-fall for 
about twenty-five seconds. 
The course is then repeated, 
in Hawking 's case eight 
times. 

Hawking had a second 
motive for taking this flight, 
and, he hopes, his upcoming 
space flight - spreading his 



conviction that colonizing 
other planets is the only hope 
for an extended future for us. 



It will be difficult 
enough to avoid 
disaster on planet 
earth in the next 100 
years, let alone the 
next 1000 or million. 
The human race 
shouldn't have all its 
eggs in one basket or 



on one planet. Getting 
a portion of the 
human race 
permanently off the 
planet is imperative 
for our future as a 
species.— 

There is, he insisted, a huge 
future mass market for space- 
oriented services in tourism. 
'We need to engage the 
entrepreneurial engine that 



has reduced the cost of 
everything from airline 
tickets to personal 
computers.' 24 

Hawking 's third motive 
for taking the flight was to 
encourage other disabled 
people to get out and try 
things like this. If he can do 
it, so can others. While that 
may not be true when it 
comes to theorizing about the 
origin of the universe, when it 



comes to adventures like 
weightlessness, why not? The 
answer that most immediately 
comes to mind is, of course, 
the price. 

Itinerant physicist 

2008 was a phenomenally 
busy year of travel for 
Hawking, and even more so 
for his valiant personal 
assistant, Judith Croasdell, 
whose task it was to make 



preparatory journeys to 
reconnoitre, plan the visits 
with his hosts, and make all 
the necessary on-the-spot 
arrangements. She had been 
told when she was hired that 
'the personal assistant does 
not travel'. That may have 
been true for other PAs, but 
not for Judith. 

In January the destination 
was Chile; the occasion a 
scientific meeting in Valdivia 



to celebrate the sixtieth 
birthday of Chile's most 
distinguished physicist, the 
charismatic Claudio Bunster. 
Bunster had been responsible 
for Hawking' s visit to Chile 
and Antarctica ten years 
earlier. From Chile, braving 
the difficulty of taking 
Hawking in his wheelchair to 
a remote part of the world 
with dauntingly uneven 
terrain where disabled access 



was only just beginning to be 
considered an important 
addition, his entourage flew 
with him to Easter Island. For 
Judith Croasdell, who had 
lived in the Southern 
Hemisphere in the Pacific 
islands herself for many years 
and been a student of Pacific 
history, this trip was 'the 
Holy Grail'. 

In May it was South 
Africa. In Cape Town, 



Hawking visited the African 
Institute for Mathematical 
Sciences (AIMS), an institute 
for postgraduate study that 
draws top students from all 
over Africa and supports the 
development of mathematics 
and science across the 
continent. Hawking' s friend 
and colleague Neil Turok, the 
founder of AIMS, helped 
organize that trip. Hawking 
met Nelson Mandela and 



launched the Next Einstein 
Initiative, a programme at 
AIMS that Hawking said, in 
his lecture, he hoped would 
nurture 'An African 
Einstein'. 

In September, hosted by 
the University of Santiago de 
Compostela, Hawking 
touched down in that famous, 
beautiful Spanish pilgrimage 
city, to receive the Fonseca 
Prize, an award that 



celebrates 
individuals 



outstanding 
in the 



communication of science to 
the general public. Judith 
Croasdell remembers that 'it 
was a tough trip, with high 
expectations and a huge press 
conference. The press 
conference was far too long, 
the press asked far too many 
questions (over forty 
questions for Stephen to 
choose from). Stephen 



answered about fourteen - 
which was a lot.' Lucy 
accompanied him on this 
journey, to publicize the 
Spanish edition of George's 
Secret Key to the Universe. 

With far-flung travels 
evidently on his mind that 
year, in his lecture at Caltech 
Hawking was a little less 
pessimistic about the 
possibility of travelling 
through a wormhole to 



another universe. He pointed 
to a new possibility, black 
holes in the extra dimensions 
of space-time. Light wouldn't 
propagate through the extra 
dimensions, only through our 
familiar four, but gravity 
would affect them and be 
much stronger than what we 
experience. That would make 
it easier for a little black hole 
to form in the extra 
dimensions. 



In this lecture, while 
giving background about 
black holes in general, he 
described Hawking radiation 
in a different way. He wasn't 
reneging on the version 
involving particle pairs, it 
was just an alternative way of 
thinking about it. If a particle 
is in a very small black hole, 
you know with fair accuracy 
where it is. Because of the 
uncertainty principle, the 



more certain you are about its 
position, the less certain you 
are going to be about its 
speed. So the smaller the 
black hole the more 
uncertainty about a particle's 
speed. It could even be more 
than the speed of light, and 
that would allow the particle 
to escape from the black hole. 
In this description, Hawking 
radiation does come from 
inside the black hole. 



Could you possibly fall 
into a black hole and come 
out in another universe? He 
thought that might be 
possible. He had not given up 
on the idea of wormholes. 
But you couldn't come back 
again, so he, personally, is 
not going to try it, in spite of 
being one of the most intrepid 
and eager-to-travel people in 
the world.

'I've always gone in a 
somewhat different 
direction' 

'it is astonishing that bold 
predictions of events in the 
first moments of the universe 
now can be confronted with 



solid measurements,' 
exclaimed WMAP's principal 
investigator, Charles Bennett, 
in March 2008. 1 'Fifth year 
results' had shown that the 
WMAP satellite's data was 
placing tighter constraints on 
inflation theories while 
supporting inflation in 
general. At the same time, 
WMAP had discovered 
something no one had 
predicted - a mysterious 



break in the overall random 
distribution of the 
temperature variations in the 
CMBR - a 'cold spot'. 2 All 
that could be said definitively 
about it was 'watch this spot', 
but so far none of the 
suggested explanations cause 
a problem for inflation 
theory. 

The race to find 
experimental and 
observational evidence to 



confirm what had been 
theoretical for a long time 
was happening not only out in 
space but also on the ground 
- and deep under it. With the 
switch-on of the Large 
Hadron Collider at CERN, on 
1 1 September 2008, 
expectations were running 
high that this long-awaited 
instrument could at last reveal 
the Higgs boson. 



Hawking v. Higgs 

Peter Higgs had proposed the 
Higgs boson's existence in 
1964 and seen it become part 
of the standard model of 
cosmological theory. At a 
press conference in 2008 he 
reacted heatedly - 'launched 
an attack' was the way the 
Sunday Times headline put it- 
- to a comment Hawking had 
made in an interview on the 
BBC. 



The less than cordial 
relationship between Higgs 
and Hawking dated back to 
1996. Hawking had published 
a paper in which he had 
stated that it would be 
impossible to observe the 
Higgs particle. By 2000 he 
had not been proved wrong. 
When the Large Electron 
Positron (LEP) experiment at 
CERN was finally closed 
down that year without 



having produced definitive 
proof of the Higgs particle, 
Hawking raked in $100 on a 
bet with colleague Gordon 
Kane at the University of 
Michigan. Another Hawking 
bet against the Higgs particle 
was still unsettled, awaiting 
the end of similar 
experiments at Fermilab near 
Chicago. The exchange 
between Hawking and Higgs 
pushed the usual limits of 



heated scientific discussions 
when Higgs, at a dinner in 
Edinburgh in 2002, said of 
Hawking that it was 'difficult 
to engage him in discussion, 
so he has got away with 
pronouncements in a way that 
other people would not. His 
celebrity status gives him 
instant credibility that others 
do not have.' Hawking 
countered with: 'I would 
hope one could discuss 



scientific issues without 
personal attacks', and Higgs 
privately made peace by 
explaining to Hawking the 
context of his comments. 
Hawking said he was not 
offended, and things settled 
down, but Hawking never 
swerved from his opinion that 
the Higgs particle was 
beyond the reach of any 
experiment. 

In a press conference 



shortly before the switch-on 
date for the LHC in 
September 2008, Hawking 
opened old wounds with the 
comment that he thought 'it 
will be much more exciting if 
we don't find the Higgs. That 
will show something is 
wrong, and we need to think 
again. I have a bet of $100 
that we won't find the 
Higgs.'- Higgs reacted with 
disparaging remarks about 



Hawking 's work: 'From a 
particle physics, quantum 
theory point of view, you 
have to put a lot more than 
just gravity into the theory to 
have a consistent theory and I 
don't think Stephen has done 
that. I am very doubtful about 
his calculations.'- Hawking 
had argued there might be 
more interesting outcomes 
from the LHC, such as the 
discovery of some of the 



supersymmetric partners. 
'Their existence would be a 
key confirmation of string 
theory,' said Hawking, 'and 
they could make up the 
mysterious dark matter that 
holds galaxies together. But 
whatever the LHC finds, or 
fails to find, the results will 
tell us a lot about the 
structure of the universe.'- 
The Sunday Times comment 
that 'their spat is likely to 



send Shockwaves through the 
scientific Establishment' was 
something of an 

overstatement, but the 79- 
year-old Higgs could not be 
blamed too much for being 
passionately eager for his 
theory, finally, to be 
confirmed. 

Hawking had other fish to 
fry in the LHC. He had 
mentioned in his most recent 
Caltech lecture that he 



thought it might be possible 
to observe microscopic black 
holes resulting from 
collisions in the Collider. If 
so, these black holes should 
be radiating particles in a 
pattern we would recognize 
as Hawking radiation. 2 He 
might get a Nobel Prize.— He 
had also mentioned again that 
fluctuations in the CMBR can 
be thought of as Hawking 
radiation from the 



inflationary period of our 
universe, now frozen in. 

Unfortunately for Higgs 
and Hawking and a lot of 
other people, just nine days 
after the Large Hadron 
Collider was switched on, 
CERN had to switch it off 
again. A faulty electrical 
connection allowed a helium 
leak into the tunnel housing 
the collider and caused the 
superconductor magnets that 



steer sub-atomic particles 
around the collider to 
malfunction. It took a year to 
get the LHC back in action. 

The Higgs particle, at the 
time of this writing, continues 
to be elusive. As of late 
February 2011, after a short 
winter maintenance break, 
researchers were gearing up 
for yet another try. 'We know 
that we will either discover 
the Higgs particle or rule it 



out, and in either case it will 
be a big result,' Sergio 
Bertolucci, CERN's Director 
for Research and Scientific 
Computing, said. 'Of course, 
it's more difficult to sell as a 
big result if we don't find it, 
but if the Higgs doesn't exist, 
there must be something else 
in its place. '- 



The Time Eater 

That September of 2008 



when Higgs and he were 
renewing their altercation, 
Hawking had the honour of 
unveiling a harrowingly 
beautiful addition to the 
streetscape in the old centre 
of Cambridge. Corpus Christi 
College, which has the most 
ancient court in Cambridge, 
became home to this newest 
phenomenon, a very large 
mechanical clock on the 
corner where Bene't Street 



meets King's Parade.- It has 
no hands but tells the 
seconds, minutes and hours 
with what appear to be small 
flashing blue tear- shaped 
lights moving in concentric 
circles around a gleaming 
clockface that is five feet in 
diameter. Plated in pure gold, 
the huge face is designed to 
look like ripples and troughs 
radiating out, as if a stone had 
dropped into a pond of 



molten metal. The ripples 
represent the explosion of the 
Big Bang, sending out 
pulsating gold. 

The shining contraption 
honours one of history's 
greatest clockmakers, John 
Harrison, the eighteenth- 
century pioneer of longitude, 
one of whose inventions was 
a 'grasshopper escapement'. 
The Corpus clock's maker 
and donor, John Taylor, was 



an undergraduate at Corpus in 
the 1950s and has since been 
a phenomenally successful 
inventor. He also has a 
passion for old clocks. Taylor 
chose to make his 
'grasshopper' a fearsome, 
crusty giant locust. This 
beast, at once menacing, 
beautiful and whimsical, 
creeps inexorably along the 
top rim of the clock. It 
operates by putting its claws 



into the teeth of the great 
clockwork escape wheel that 
rotates around the outer edge 
of the clock face and, like 
Harrison's grass-hopper, 
restrains and measures out the 
speed of rotation. This 
sinister monster is the 
'chronophage' or 'time 
eater'. 1 - 0 

When the Corpus clock 
strikes the hour it tolls off the 
numbers not with chimes but 



with a rattle made by shaking 
iron chains over a wooden 
coffin, with a hammer beating 
the wooden lid, all inside the 
back of the clock. 

It seemed appropriate that 
Hawking should unveil this 
awesome device. Nearly 
everyone associates Stephen 
Hawking with the Big Bang 
and time's 'brief history'. He 
has tamed time by turning it 
into another space dimension. 



He has also seemed 
miraculously to have 
stretched out his own time - 
defying, perhaps, that horrific 
creature on top of the clock. 

A quieter celebration 

But time was indeed passing, 
even for Hawking. A year 
later, on 30 September 2009, 
obeying a dictum of the 
University of Cambridge that 
Lucasian Professors of 



Mathematics retire at the age 
of sixty-seven, he 
relinquished the title he had 
held for thirty years. His 
successor would be Michael 
Green, a distinguished 
theoretical physicist 
specializing in string theory. 

In contrast to the 
celebration of Hawking 's 
sixtieth birthday, his stepping 
down as Lucasian Professor 
was marked quietly with a 



champagne reception in the 
department. His retirement 
meant little change. His busy 
schedule, his research, his 
status in the DAMTP stayed 
much the same. His title 
would now be Director of 
Research for the Cambridge 
Centre for Theoretical 
Cosmology. He kept his 
spacious corner office, and 
his personal assistant and 
graduate assistant were not 



ejected from the cluster of 
offices around him. In an 
audio message to BBC 
News night, Hawking 
reiterated that he was not 
really retiring, merely 
changing titles, and added: 

It has been a glorious 
time to be alive and 
doing research in 
theoretical physics. 
Our picture of the 



universe has changed 
a great deal in the last 
forty years, and I'm 
happy if I have made 
a small contribution. I 
want to share my 
excitement and 
enthusiasm. There ' s 
nothing like the 
Eureka moment of 
discovering something 
that no one knew 
before. I won't 



compare it to sex, but 
it lasts longer. 11 

For the past year, 
Hawking had been making 
threatening statements about 
the possibility of his leaving 
Cambridge and England - his 
way of protesting at the 
proposed draconian cuts in 
public funding for the kind of 
basic research he does and the 
kind of scientific education 



that he tries to inspire young 
people to choose. Funds were 
to be channelled instead into 
industrial applications of 
science, science that some 
thought would bring money 
into the UK. Hawking had 
been protesting about such 
priorities calling them 
'ignorant of the past, and 
blind to the future' - for over 
a decade. 'To demand that 
research projects should all 



be industrially relevant is 
ridiculous. How many of the 
great discoveries of the past 
that laid the foundations for 
our modern technology were 
made through industrially 
motivated research? The 
answer is, hardly any.'— 

If he moved, where would 
he go? Hawking had enjoyed 
working as a visitor at the 
Perimeter Institute for 
Theoretical Physics, a state- 



of-the-art research centre in 
Waterloo, Ontario, where 
Neil Turok was now Director. 
There were rumours that in 
retirement he would take up a 
post there. However, 
Hawking did not abandon 
Cambridge and probably 
never will. In spite of change 
of title, funding cuts, and 
inexorably deteriorating 
physical condition and ability 
to communicate his ideas, his 



goal remained as mind- 
bogglingly ambitious as ever: 
'A complete understanding of 
the universe, why it is as it is, 
and why it exists at all.'— 
And how long was that going 
to take? In an interview on 
the Charlie Rose Show, the 
previous year, Hawking had 
been asked that question. He 
had replied by repeating the 
words he had used in 1980, in 
his inaugural lecture as 



Lucasian Professor: 'by the 
end of the century'. Then he 
added with a cagey grin that 
though his estimate remained 
the same, there was a lot 
more of the twenty-first 
century left than there had 
been of the twentieth when he 
first made that prediction. 

Hawking ' s graduate 
assistant, Sam Blackburn, had 
set 2009 off with a literal 
bang by courageously giving 



him a mini-rocket-launcher 
for his birthday. With this 
'office toy', he could send 
missiles sailing across the 
room. In March he had 
travelled to Los Angeles and 
met his granddaughter Rose 
for the first time. He and 
Lucy had dedicated the 
second of their 'George' 
books to her. Rose and her 
older brother George are 
children of Robert Hawking 



and his wife Katrina. 

Hawking made another of 
his lecture stops in Pasadena, 
California. The frenzy of the 
occasion was not at all 
unusual for him. It was 
happening several times, 
sometimes even many times, 
every year, and even at 
Caltech, by then almost home 
territory. 



Space, the Final 



Frontier 

Heralded by the opening 
fanfare from Richard 
Straus s ' s Also Sprach 
Zarathustra, he made his 
entrance to the convention 
centre, filled to capacity with 
4,500 people. Those who 
didn't know the music by that 
name still recognized it as the 
thundering background music 
of the film 2001: A Space 
Odyssey. Hawking could no 



longer use his hands to drive 
his own wheelchair, a sad 
change, but, hands folded in 
his lap, he was wheeled down 
the aisle at considerable 
speed. The Blue Danube 
Waltz - not quite so huge and 
impressive, more friendly - 
replaced Richard Strauss with 
Johann Strauss as he started 
up the ramp to the stage. The 
audience waited. Nothing 
happened for a little while. A 



glitch? A way of heightening 
expectation? Hawking ' s 
graduate assistant came out 
and made some adjustments 
to Hawking's laptop. 
Hawking 's hands remained 
immobile in his lap. He was 
controlling his computer with 
a movement of his cheek 
muscle. Soon came the voice 
and the words everyone was 
waiting for: 'Can you hear 
me?' The Caltech crowd 



cheered. Stephen Hawking 
was back! 

Hawking 's lecture was 
'Why We Should Go into 
Space',- which he had 
written the previous year as a 
fiftieth-birthday present for 
NASA and delivered in 
Washington, DC. It was a 
more adult version of the 
chapter by that same title in 
the 'User's Guide to the 
Universe' in George's 



Cosmic Treasure Hunt, 
published in 2007. One part 
of the talk that he had not 
included in that book had to 
do with the cost of space 
travel, which Hawking 
admitted would not come 
cheap but would still 
represent only a small 
fraction of world GDP, even 
if the present USA national 
budget for space exploration 
were to be increased twenty 



times. He recommended a 
goal of a base on the moon by 
2020 and a manned landing 
on Mars by 2025, not only in 
the interest of space 
exploration but to reignite 
public interest in space and 
science in general. 'A high 
proportion of space scientists 
say their interest in science 
was sparked by watching the 
moon landings,' he said. 

Would we find life out 



there? Hawking was thinking 
that even if the probability is 
small of life appearing on a 
suitable planet, in a universe 
as large as ours, life must 
have appeared somewhere 
else besides Earth. The 
distances between the places 
where it has appeared were 
likely to be extremely large 
and the life would almost 
certainly not all be DNA- 
based. Another possibility is 



that meteors may have spread 
life from planet to planet and 
even from stellar system to 
stellar system. If life spread 
in this way (the process is 
called panspermia) then it 
would not be surprising to 
find other DNA-based life at 
locations in our own neck of 
the woods. 

One bit of evidence that 
panspermia may have been 
the source of life on Earth, he 



pointed out, is that life here 
appeared suspiciously quickly 
after the first moment that it 
would have been possible. 
The Earth was formed 4.6 
billion years ago and for the 
first half-billion years was too 
hot for life to emerge. The 
earliest evidence of life 
comes from 3.5 billion years 
ago. That means life appeared 
only about a half a billion 
years after it was first 



possible. A long time, that 
might seem, but actually 
amazingly short. 

We haven't of course 
been visited by aliens (at 
least, we don't think so - 
'Why should they appear 
only to cranks and weirdos?') 
and there seem to be no 
advanced, intelligent beings 
near us in the galaxy. The 
SETI project has heard no 
alien TV quiz shows. There is 



probably no alien civilization 
at our stage of development 
within a few hundred light 
years of us. 'Issuing an 
insurance policy against 
abduction by aliens seems a 
pretty safe bet. ' 

Hawking mentioned three 
possible reasons why we 
haven't heard from any 
aliens. 

First, the probability of 
life appearing on a suitable 



planet may be too low. 

Second, even if that 
probability is high, the 
probability of this life 
evolving into intelligent life 
may be too low. (It isn't clear 
that intelligence confers long- 
term survival advantage. 
Think of bacteria and 
insects.) 

Third, intelligent beings 
who reach the stage of 
sending radio signals also 



have reached the stage of 
building nuclear bombs or 
similar weapons of mass 
destruction, and they may 
always destroy themselves 
very soon. Hawking calls that 
a sick joke, but he has also 
said that if extraterrestrial life 
has not destroyed itself, given 
the short time- span of life on 
Earth compared with the age 
of the universe, it is still 
unlikely that we would meet 



an example of alien life at a 
recognizably human stage. It 
would either be much more 
primitive than we are or so 
advanced that it would regard 
us as impossibly primitive. 

Hawking favours the 
second possibility, the rarity 
not of life but of intelligent 
life. 'Some would say it has 
yet to occur on earth.' Why 
are we smiling? 

Hawking 's lecture was 



long and thoughtful. He 
answered questions chosen 
ahead of time from those 
submitted by students and 
others in the Caltech 
community: how close are we 
to the Star Trek world? Don't 
expect warp drive or 
replicators. We will have to 
'do it the hard way', slower 
than light speed. To reach 
distant destinations we'll 
need more than one 



generation. The journeys 
would be so long that the 
crews would even have time 
to evolve differently, so that 
the human race would divide 
into different species. 

At the end of his visit to 
California, Hawking was not 
well enough to continue to 
Phoenix, as had been 
planned. Lucy appeared there 
instead and his pre-prepared 
lecture was broadcast over 



speakers. Back home in 
Cambridge, Hawking was in 
hospital for observation for a 
brief time, but all this turned 
out yet again to be only a 
temporary setback. He was 
back in fine form well ahead 
of an August trip to 
Washington, DC, to receive a 
Presidential Medal of 
Freedom from US President 
Barack Obama. In September, 
in Switzerland, where he 



visited CERN and the 
University of Geneva, his 
lecture The Creation of the 
Universe' filled one theatre 
and (by video link) ten other 
auditoriums. 

It was his appearance in 
Washington to receive his 
medal that triggered a 
comment that unexpectedly 
drew him into the debate 
raging in the United States 
while President Obama was 



struggling to get a health care 
bill through Congress. One 
outspoken opponent of all 
public health care, 
disparaging the British 
system, commented that 'If 
Stephen Hawking had been 
British, he'd be dead by 
now!' Hawking responded 
that he was, of course, British 
and lived in Cambridge, 
England, and that 'the 
National Health Service has 



taken great care of me for 
over forty years. I have 
received excellent medical 
attention in Britain. I believe 
in universal health care.'— 
Jane Hawking might not have 
been so upbeat about the 
NHS, given her 

disappointments with them. 

In February 2010, the 
Planetary Society of 
Pasadena, California, 
awarded Hawking the 



Cosmos 
Outstanding 



Award 



for 
Public 



Presentation of Science. 
Previous honorees had been 
James Cameron, creator of 
the film Avatar, and NOVA 
producer Paula Apsell.- With 
Hawking 's health again 
uncertain, a delegation 
travelled from California to 
Cambridge to make the 
presentation. The society's 
mission is 'to inspire the 



people of Earth to explore 
other worlds, understand our 
own, and seek life 
elsewhere'. The press release 
announcing the presentation 
event in Cambridge ended 
with the words: 'Tickets are 
sold out.' 

Hawking unveiled 
another reminder of the swift 
passage of time in the spring 
of 2010. It was an unusual 
experience, having a garden 



named for him at the annual 
Royal Horticultural Society 
Chelsea Flower Show in 
London. The 'Stephen 
Hawking Garden for Motor 
Neurone Disease: A Brief 
History of Time' was 
dedicated not only to him but 
to all whose lives have been 
affected by motor neurone 
disease - patients, families, 
carers - and it was indeed a 
garden of mixed emotions. A 



spiral path representing the 
Earth's plant history led 
visitors from an area with 
some of the most ancient 
species of plants and ended 
near the centre of the garden 
with 'productive 
Mediterranean type plants 
that could produce food for us 
in the future, if climatic 
conditions allow'. At the 
centre of the garden was a 
pool in which water appeared 



to fall into a dark, hopeless 
vortex - representing a black 
hole - the end of time. 
Nearby, set into a drystone 
wall, was an antique clock, 
representing the swiftness 
with which time disappears 
for those with motor neurone 
disease. Queen Elizabeth met 
Hawking in the garden to 
admire the design, converse 
with him, and congratulate 
him. 



Verdict from the 
Skies 

WMAP ended its mission in 
2009. A results summary in 
January 2010 announced that 
the large-scale temperature 
fluctuations in the CMBR are 
slightly more intense than the 
small-scale ones - a subtle 
but key prediction of many 
inflation models - and 
confirmed that the universe is 



indeed flat.- This second 
conclusion was supported 
even more strongly than 
before by the overall 
randomness of locations of 
hot and cold points in the 
CMBR.- 

As the wmap mission was 
preparing to wind down,— in 
May 2009 the European 
Space Agency launched its 
Planck satellite. Some of its 
detectors are designed to 



operate at a temperature of 
minus 273.05°C, just a tenth 
of a degree above absolute 
zero. A formal release of 
fully prepared CMBR 
images, analyses and 
scientific papers was not 
expected before 2013, but the 
ESA made a preliminary 
announcement of some 
results in January 2011. 'We 
haven't got to the real 
treasure yet, the cosmic 



microwave background 
itself,'- said David 
Southwood, ESA Director of 
Science and Robotic 
Exploration. The project's 
first goal had been to weed 
out some foreground sources 
that hamper studies of the 
CMBR. Many things may 
have affected this radiation 
during the evolution of the 
universe, 'a whole lot of dirty 
astrophysics'- complicating 



the picture - irregularities 
from gravitational lensing, 
radio sources, black holes, 
even instrument noise. The 
Planck scientists had in 
particular been focusing on 
the 'anomalous microwave 
emission', a glow associated 
with dense dusty regions of 
the galaxy, and been able to 
confirm that it comes from 
dust grains set spinning by 
collisions with either fast- 



moving atoms or ultraviolet 
light. Filtering out this 
microwave 'fog' from the 
data would not distort the 
CMBR. It would leave the 
CMBR untouched and allow 
Planck's data to reveal the 
cosmic microwave 
background in unprecedented 
detail. 21 

As observations of the 
CMBR become more detailed 
and precise, it becomes more 



of a challenge for any model 
to agree with the findings. 
Success in hitting that target 
becomes more and more 
convincing evidence to 
support a model. Some 
models are winnowed out. 
But, so far, the agreement 
between observations and 
predictions having to do with 
the CMBR and the universe's 
overall shape, large-scale 
smoothness, and smaller- 



scale structure look promising 
for inflationary cosmology.— 
As John Barrow summed it 
up, 'The growing 

observational evidence for the 
distinctive pattern of 
temperature variations in the 
microwave background 
radiation means that we take 
very seriously the idea that 
our visible portion of the 
universe underwent a surge of 
inflation in its very earliest 



stages. - 

Gravity waves from the 
moments right after the Big 
Bang are predicted to have 
left a distinct footprint in the 
CMBR,- but this footprint 
was proving elusive. 
However, there are other 
potentially better ways to 
look for gravity waves. Kip 
Thorne, because of his 
abiding interest in black 
holes, has been working with 



colleagues for some time to 
develop instruments that can 
detect and measure more 
directly gravity waves that 
originate in black hole events, 
and in the early universe. One 
technique is laser 

interferometry. 

The interferometer is a 
device that splits a laser beam 
into two beams, 

perpendicular to one another. 
Each beam bounces off a 



mirror that sends it back 
along its path. The two beams 
are recombined when they 
meet. Each of the mirrors has 
a large mass attached to it, so 
if a gravity wave passes 
through the interferometer, 
stretching and contracting 
space between the masses 
(and hence the mirrors), that 
displaces them slightly and 
changes the distances the 
beams travel, producing 



interference patterns in the 
laser light ( see Figure 19.1 ).

Thome) 

Earth-based gravity wave 
detectors are already in place 
in Hanford, Washington 
(LIGO); Hanover, Germany; 
and Pisa, Italy; but the 
grandmother of all such 
instruments, an astoundingly 
outsized arrangement, is 
scheduled to be launched into 



space in the form of three 
separate spacecraft, together 
known as LISA, the Laser 
Interferometer Space 
Antenna. Once in place, the 
three spacecraft will form a 
triangle with sides 5 million 
kilometres long. It will take 
approximately 20 seconds for 
light to travel between them. 
( See Figure 19.2 .) When 
gravitational waves, 
stretching and squeezing 



space, pass through this 
enormous 'apparatus', their 
passage will alter slightly the 
distance between the 
spacecraft, and the distance 
travelled by the light beams 
between them, causing an 
interference of the light 
beams that can be measured 
with extremely sensitive 
instruments.- LIGO and 
LISA were two of the 
instruments that Kip Thorne 



was talking about when he 
promised Hawking on his 
sixtieth birthday that 
gravitational wave detectors - 
ligo, geo, virgo and LISA - 
would test his 'Golden- Age 
black-hole predictions' well 
before his seventieth 
birthday.- They had better 
get cracking!

Interferometer Space Antenna,

Follow-ups to WMAP, 
Planck and LISA will be the 
NASA Einstein Inflation 
Probe, which will focus on 
the CMBR, and the Big Bang 
Observer, which will study 
gravity waves. The two 
approaches together may lead 
finally to something no 
probes or studies, including 
the highly successful WMAP, 



have yet been able to give us: 
the long- sought 

understanding of the physical 
mechanism and energy scales 
of inflation itself.— 
Gravitational waves offer the 
most direct opportunity we 
are likely ever to have to 
probe what the universe was 
like during the first split 
second of its existence. 

Will this observational 
evidence show conclusively 



whether or not inflation 
actually did happen? Inflation 
theory makes predictions 
about what the patterns and 
characteristics of the 
gravitational waves should be 
like. If they turn out to match 
those predictions, that will be 
strong evidence. If no 
gravitational waves can be 
detected, that would support 
another model, the ekpyrotic 
model of the universe in 



which inflation does not 
occur but our universe was 
created by the exceedingly 
slow collision of two three- 
dimensional brane worlds 
moving in a hidden extra 
(fourth) dimension of space. 

Out on a Limb 

When it comes to the bigger 
picture suggested by eternal 
inflation, it seems such an 
idea ought to be impossible to 



test from our blinkered 
vantage point within our own 
universe. What evidence 
could be lying around within 
our very limited reach? 

Stephen Hawking and his 
colleagues are far from giving 
up on the possibility of 
making relevant predictions 
that can be set against more 
precise future observations, 
perhaps by the Planck 
satellite. In a paper in 



September 2010, Hawking, 
Jim Hartle and Thomas 
Hertog admitted that there is 
'no way the mosaic structure 
[of universes] can be 
observed. We don't see the 
whole universe but only a 
nearly homogeneous region 
[that lies within the range of 
our observations], within our 
past lightcone'.- However, in 
spite of the possibility that 
much larger fluctuations are 



observable only on scales 
much more enormous than 
we can study - on 'super 
horizon scales'— - they 
thought that the no-boundary 
wave function could come to 
their aid in calculating small 
departures from homogeneity 
within the part of the universe 
that it is possible for us to 
observe. The absence or 
presence of randomness in 
the spectrum of temperature 



variations in the CMBR does, 
they claimed, provide useful 
information about the bigger 
picture - and whether there is 
a bigger picture. 

Just as the 'quantum wave 
function' for a particle gives 
every possible path the 
particle could follow between 
two points, the no-boundary 
wave function represents all 
the physically possible 
histories our universe might 



have had if it began in the 
way Hartle and Hawking 
proposed. In a previous 
paper, in January 2010, they 
had reported looking at a 
range of these different 
universe histories.— With an 
infinite number of 
possibilities, calculating 
which are more probable was 
a questionable undertaking. 
However, Hartle, Hawking 
and Hertog - without 



resorting to renormalization 
procedures of the sort 
Richard Feynman had called 
'dippy' when he used them 
himself to handle infinities - 
felt confident in coming to 
some conclusions.— They 
divided the universe histories 
they were studying into two 
groups. 

First, consider universe 
models in whose histories 
eternal inflation is not likely 



to have played a part. In other 
words, these are probably not 
part of a larger scheme of 
universes produced by eternal 
inflation. If we live in that 
kind of universe, and if it 
appears to us to be like the 
universe we know today, and 
if Hartle, Hawking and 
Hertog are correct in thinking 
they can make valid use of 
the no-boundary wave 
function in their calculations, 



then what do those 
calculations lead us to 
expect? 

1. in the cmbr, on 
scales we can 
observe, a 
certain pattern 
of non- 
randomness in 
the spectrum of 
temperature 
variations; 



2. beyond our 
ability to 
observe, on 
huge scales, an 
over-all 
homogeneity; 

3. only a small 
amount of 
inflation in our 
past. 



Observations of the CMBR, 
though they can't show us 



item (2), do not seem to back 
up those predictions. 

So, consider another 
group of universe models. 
These universes are likely to 
be part of an eternal inflation 
picture. If we live in that kind 
of universe, and, again, if it 
appears to us to be like the 
universe we know today - 
and if Hartle, Hawking and 
Hertog are correct in thinking 
they can make valid use of 



the no-boundary wave 
function in their calculations 
- what do these calculations 
lead us to expect? 

1. in the cmbr, on 
scales we can 
observe, a high 
degree of 
randomness in 
the spectrum of 
temperature 
variations; 



2. beyond our 
ability to 
observe, on 
huge scales, a 
significant 
amount of 
inhomogeneity; 

3. a longer period 
of inflation in 
our past. 



That's more like it! Or so it 
seems, so far. The absence or 



presence of (and the degree 
of) randomness that we can 
observe in the CMBR is a key 
issue. 

Hartle, Hawking and 
Hertog decided, however, to 
go further out on a limb: their 
September 2010 paper 
reported that they calculate 
that our universe probably 
ended its inflationary period 
at the lowest potential value 
of the field.- They predict, 



rather precisely, observations 
in the area we can observe 
(within our light cone) - not 
only that there will be a high 
degree of randomness in the 
spectrum of temperature 
variations in the CMBR, but 
also the degree and manner in 
which, if eternal inflation is 
correct, the distribution and 
spectrum of the variations 
will depart from complete 
randomness.— The departure 



will be extremely small and 
not easy to detect. 

Now, we wait to see 
whether Planck and other 
future probes will be able to 
produce precise enough 
measurements to test those 
predictions, as well as show a 
specific pattern of slight 
fluctuations in temperature in 
the CMBR predicted by 
Hawking and Hartle's no- 
boundary proposal itself. The 



Planck satellite may also be 
able to detect paths of light 
rays that have been bent in 
specific ways, indicating that 
our universe has a geometry 
predicted by some multiverse 
and eternal inflation models.— 

Down-to-Earth 
Hawking Radiation 

While Hawking, Hartle and 
Hertog had been thinking 



about what possible evidence 
might underpin eternal- 
inflation theory, another 
group of physicists were 
working on an experiment 
that might just possibly create 
Hawking radiation, not at the 
border of a black hole or from 
an event horizon in the early 
universe but in a laboratory. 
Daniele Faccio of the 
University of Insubria, Italy, 
and his team of researchers 



reported in a paper accepted 
by Physical Review Letters in 
late September 2010 that they 
had succeeded. M Their 
experiment involved firing 
laser light into a block of 
glass. 

The idea is that as the 
laser pulse moves through the 
glass block it changes the 
speed at which light is 
capable of travelling there 
(the 'refractive index' of the 



glass). Light near the pulse is 
slowed more and more as the 
pulse passes through and the 
refractive index changes. If a 
pulse (call it pulse A) were 
sent chasing after a slower, 
weaker pulse (pulse B), it 
would gradually catch up and 
that would reduce the speed 
of light near pulse B. Pulse B 
would slow down more and 
more, eventually so much that 
it would get stuck. The 



leading edge of pulse A, 
acting like the event horizon 
of a black hole, would have 
sucked it in. 

Recall the discussion of 
Hawking radiation: pairs of 
particles continually appear. 
The two particles in a pair 
start out together and then 
move apart. After an interval 
of time too short to imagine, 
they come together again and 
annihilate one another. Near 



the event horizon of a black 
hole, before the pair are able 
to meet again and annihilate, 
the one with negative energy 
may cross the event horizon 
into the black hole. The 
particle with positive energy 
might fall into the black hole, 
too, of course, but it doesn't 
have to. It's free of the 
partnership. It can escape as 
Hawking radiation. To an 
observer at a distance it 



appears to come out of the 
black hole. In fact, it comes 
from just outside. Meanwhile, 
its partner has carried 
negative energy into the black 
hole. 

Faccio and his team 
watched just such particles - 
photons in this case - to see 
whether, as the pulse passed 
through the glass, its event 
horizon would sweep in one 
of a pair, allowing the other 



to escape as Hawking 
radiation. They set up a 
camera, focused it on the 
block of glass, and then fired 
3,600 pulses from the laser. 
The camera recorded a faint 
glow in exactly the range of 
frequencies that Hawking 
radiation predicts. Carefully 
ruling out other sources of the 
glow, the researchers decided 
that they had in fact observed 
Hawking radiation. 



Might this get Hawking a 
Nobel Prize, which is very 
seldom given for even the 
most promising theories if 
there is no experimental or 
observational evidence to 
support them? In November 
2010, not long after the 
announcement of the 
experiment in Insubria, I 
asked Hawking whether he 
thought Faccio and his team 
had actually discovered 



Hawking radiation. His reply 
was enigmatic: 'I will not get 
the Nobel Prize.' 

fnl The Nobel Prize is very 
seldom given for even the 
most promising theories if 
there is no experimental or 
observational evidence to 
support them. 
fn2 WMAP was finally 
consigned to 'graveyard 
orbit' in October 2010. 



fn3 Quoting Hartle, Hawking, 
and Hertog's September 2010 
paper directly, to give a feel 
for what all this sounds like 
in the language of theoretical 
physics: ' ... an essentially 
Gaussian spectrum of 
microwave fluctuations with 
a scalar spectral index n8 & 
$126;. 97 and a tensor to 
scalar ratio of about 10%'

'My name is Stephen 
Hawking: physicist, 
cosmologist and 
something of a 
dreamer' 

hawking' s book the grand 



design, written with Leonard 
Mlodinow, appeared in the 
early autumn of 2010 with a 
subtitle that sounded rather 
un-Hawkinglike. New 
Answers to the Ultimate 
Questions of Life. Nothing 
here of the wry humour of 
previous titles - a 'brief 
history - the universe in a 
'nutshell'. Apparently this 
book was going to get 
serious. 



The Grand Design pulled 
together the thinking and 
work Hawking has been 
doing for over half a century, 
to give us a thorough update 
on the state of the quest for a 
Theory of Everything. Here 
are Feynman's sums-over- 
histories, the anthropic 
principle, the meaning of 
'models' and 'reality', the no- 
boundary proposal, 
information loss, the 



disparagement of modern 
philosophy (this time on the 
first page rather than the last), 
the battle with God. But right 
from the beginning of the 
book one dramatic change is 
clear: the quest for a Theory 
of Everything has, indeed, 
fragmented. 

Isaac Asimov once wrote 
that 'of all the stereotypes 
that have plagued men and 
women of science, surely one 



above all has wrought harm. 
Scientists can be pictured as 
"evil", "mad", "cold", "self- 
centred", "absent-minded", 
even "square" and yet survive 
easily. Unfortunately they are 
usually pictured as "right" 
and that can distort the 
picture of science past 
redemption ' . Stephen 
Hawking 's startling about- 
faces, which you have 
witnessed throughout this 



book, shatter that stereotype. 
Hawking has a robustly 
healthy history of pulling the 
rug out from under his own 
assertions. But, as we've 
seen, what appear to be 
about-faces have hardly ever 
actually been steps backwards 
or reversals. In Hawking 's 
own version of the game 
Snakes and Ladders, snakes 
don't take him further from 
his goal. They just lead him 



off on more promising 
pathways. Be that as it may, 
giving up hope of discovering 
a fundamental Theory of 
Everything is an enormous 
shift - one that Hawking 
would not have made unless 
faced with truly unyielding 
evidence that it was 
warranted, the only way 
forward. 

Another thing that is clear 
from the start of The Grand 



Design is that Hawking no 
longer regards string theory 
with the suspicion he once 
did. It's not easy to pin down 
precisely when he changed 
his mind on this issue. Most 
accounts, not his own, have 
him still rather a^^'-strings 
well into the 1990s. However, 
he told me in 1990 ( Chapter 
13 ) that he thought 
superstring theory had 
become the most promising 



route towards a Theory of 
Everything. He was right, but 
. . . with a twist. 

The newest candidate, 
and perhaps the final claimant 
for that title of 'ultimate 
theory of the universe', is M- 
theory. As a theory of 
everything, in the time- 
honoured description, it is a 
little disappointing. M-theory 
is not simple. You can't print 
it on a T-shirt. It doesn't fulfil 



the promise of Wheeler's 
poem. It doesn't measure up 
to the Pythagorean standard, 
where beautiful clarity is a 
guide to truth. Does that 
mean it might be wrong? 
Hawking 's attitude towards it 
is not that it is right, or 
ultimate, but that it is the best 
we are ever going to do. 

M-theory is not a single 
theory. It is a collection of 
theories. Hawking describes 



them as a 'family of theories'. 
Each member of the family is 
a good description of 
observations in some range of 
physical situations, but none 
is a good description of 
observations in all physical 
situations. None can account 
for 'everything'. The theories 
may look very different from 
one another, but all are on an 
equal footing, and all can be 
thought of as aspects of the 



same underlying theory. 1 We 
don't yet know how to 
formulate that deeper theory 
as a single set of equations 
and arguably never will. 

Hawking and Mlodinow 
compare the situation to a flat 
map of the Earth. Because the 
Mercator projection used for 
such maps makes areas 
further north and south look 
larger than they really are in 
relation to other parts of the 



world (the distortion becomes 
more and more pronounced 
the further north or south on 
the map you go), and the 
North and South Poles are not 
shown at all, the entire Earth 
ends up much less accurately 
mapped than it would if we 
used, instead, a collection of 
maps, each one covering a 
limited region, overlapping. 
Where the maps overlap, they 
don't conflict; that bit of the 



landscape looks the same 
regardless of which of the 
overlapping maps you're 
consulting. Each map is 
reliable and useful for the 
area it represents. But no 
single flat map is a good 
representation of the Earth's 
surface. Just so, no single 
theory is a good 
representation of all 
observations. 2 

Today, theorists recognize 



five different string theories 
and supergravity, a version of 
which Hawking had high 
hopes for in 1980, as the 
family of approximations of 
the more fundamental theory, 
M-theory. The six 
approximations are like the 
smaller maps in Hawking' s 
map analogy. 

While this situation may 
not meet our most idealistic 
expectations for a complete 



understanding of the 
universe, we needn't sit 
around too long moaning 
about our ignorance of the 
fundamental, comprehensive, 
underlying theory. There are 
things we do know about it. 
There are ten or eleven 
dimensions of time and space. 
There are point particles, 
vibrating strings, two- 
dimensional membranes, 
three-dimensional objects, 



and other objects occupying 
up to nine (or, in some 
versions, ten) dimensions of 
space - in other words, p- 
branes. 

We have already talked 
about the idea that extra space 
dimensions beyond the three 
we experience may be 
escaping our notice because 
they are curled up tightly, and 
that the astounding number of 
different ways they can curl 



was at first discouraging to 
those who were hoping that 
string theory was going to be 
the unique theory of 
everything. Earlier we used 
the analogy involving a 
garden hose to help 
understand the curling up. 
Hawking and Mlodinow have 
found a better analogy for it. 

They ask us to imagine a 
two-dimensional plane. It 
could be, for instance, a piece 



of paper. It is two- 
dimensional because two 
numbers (horizontal and 
vertical coordinates) are 
needed to locate any point on 
it. It may not occur to you 
that a drinking straw is also 
two-dimensional. To 
designate a point on it, you 
need to show where the point 
is along its length and also 
where in its circular 
dimension. But suppose your 



straw is very, very thin. 
You'd hardly feel the need to 
think about where the point is 
in its circular dimension. If it 
were extraordinarily thin, a 
million-million-million- 
million-millionth of an inch 
in diameter, Hawking 
suggests, you wouldn't think 
it had a circular dimension at 
all. That is the way string 
theorists encourage us to 
think about the extra 



dimensions - curled or 
curved on a scale so small 
that we don't notice them. 
They speak of them as being 
curled up into 'internal 
space'. 

In the early to mid-1990s, 
theorists were becoming less 
and less discouraged by the 
astoundingly many ways 
dimensions can curl. One 
change was a new 
understanding that the 



different ways of curling up 
the extra dimensions are 
nothing but different ways of 
looking at them from our 
vantage point in four 
dimensions. However, as 
Andrei Linde suggested, the 
way the extra space 
dimensions are curled up is 
crucial. In each universe, it 
determines the universe's 
apparent laws of nature. 
However many solutions 



there are in M-theory for the 
ways internal space can be 
curled, that is how many 
different types of universe are 
allowed, all with different 
laws. The number is too large 
to comprehend. 

Hawking suggests we 
think of the emergence of 
these universes by imagining 
something like Eddington's 
balloon analogy, the balloon 
with the ant crawling on it, 



only this time it isn't a 
balloon and the ant is 
missing. In his 2006 lecture at 
Caltech, he advised his 
audience to picture the 
expanding universe as the 
surface of a bubble. Imagine, 
then, the formation of bubbles 
of steam in boiling water. 
Many tiny bubbles form and 
disappear. These are 
universes that expand only a 
little and collapse before they 



get beyond microscopic size. 
No hope of galaxies, stars, or 
intelligent life in them. Some, 
however, start out just as tiny 
but grow large enough so that 
they are out of danger of 
collapsing, at least for a long, 
long while. These expand at 
first at an ever-increasing 
rate, undergoing what we 
have come to call 'inflation'. 

The Grand Design revisits 
Richard Feynman's idea that 



a particle travelling from one 
point to another in quantum 
physics has no definite 
position while it is getting to 
its destination. That has been 
taken to mean that it takes no 
path. As we've seen, 
Feynman realized that it 
could just as easily be said to 
take every possible path 
simultaneously. In this light, 
consider the possibility of a 
great many universes, the sort 



of situation we have in eternal 
inflation. It doesn't suffice 
only to say that each universe 
has a different history. In fact, 
thinking of sums-over- 
histories, each universe has 
many possible histories and 
also many possible states 
later in its existence. Most of 
those states are totally 
unsuitable for the existence of 
life of any sort. There are 
only a minuscule few of the 



universes that would allow 
creatures like us to exist. 

Among all the possible 
alternative universes, only 
one is completely uniform 
and regular. Calculating the 
probability of this sort of 
universe, we find that it is 
very likely indeed. In fact, it 
is the most probable universe 
of all, but it isn't our 
universe. A universe like that, 
without small irregularities in 



the early universe that show 
up now as small variations in 
the CMBR, could never be a 
home for us. Ours has to be a 
universe with some regions 
slightly more dense than 
others, so that gravitational 
attraction can draw matter 
together to form galaxies, 
stars, planets and, maybe, us. 
As Hawking had put it in his 
2006 Caltech lecture, 'The 
[CMBR] map of the 



microwave sky is the 
blueprint for all the structure 
in the universe. We are the 
product of the fluctuations in 
the early universe.'- Luckily 
there are many universe 
histories that are only slightly 
un-uniform and irregular. 
These are almost as probable 
as the one that is completely 
uniform and regular. We 
don't know how many 
alternative universes end up 



producing something like 
'us', but we do know it did 
happen once. 

Another familiar concept 
that is significant in 
Hawking 's thinking about M- 
theory is the fact that on the 
quantum level of the universe 
we cannot observe without 
interfering, without changing 
the very thing we are trying 
to observe. More important 
and less familiar to most of 



us, no matter how carefully 
and completely we observe 
the present, the part of the 
past that we cannot observe 
is, like the future, indefinite. 
It exists as a range of 
possibilities, some more 
probable than others. Putting 
that together with Feynman's 
sums-over-histories, Hawking 
concludes that 'the universe 
doesn't have just a single 
history, but every possible 



history, each with its own 
probability; and our 
observations of its current 
state affect its past and 
determine the different 
histories of the uni verse'. - 
That should not sound 
entirely unfamiliar. We saw 
earlier how Hawking and 
Hartle used sums-over- 
histories when they were 
developing their no-boundary 
proposal. What has occurred 



in Hawking 's thinking is a 
change of emphasis, the 
realization that the ability of 
our observations of the 
present to decide among 
those histories has 
enormously significant 
implications for our 
understanding of the 
universe. 

Go back to thinking about 
Feynman's method of 
considering all the possible 



paths a particle might follow 
from its starting point to its 
end point. It's not so easy to 
do with the history of a 
universe. We don't know 
point A (the beginning), but 
we do, in the case of our own 
universe, know quite a lot 
about point B, where we are 
today. Hawking asks us to 
consider all the histories that 
satisfy the no-boundary 
condition (histories that are 



closed surfaces without 
boundaries - recall the globe 
of the Earth) and that end 
with the universe we know 
today (point B). There is a 
vast range of point As, 
though we can't say they 
include universe histories 
starting off in 'every possible 
way' because we are limiting 
them to those that satisfy the 
no-boundary condition. If we 
were to start our thinking at 



point A, we'd end up with 
many possible point Bs, some 
of which are similar to our 
universe today, but most of 
which are not. 

Hawking is 
recommending, instead, what 
he calls his 'top-down' 
approach to cosmology, 
tracing the alternative 
histories from the top down, 
backwards from the present 
time. It is a new view of 



cosmology, and, for that 
matter, a new view of cause 
and effect. The universe 
doesn't have a unique 
observer-independent history. 
We create the history of our 
universe by being here and 
observing it. History doesn't 
create us. 

Take, for example, the 
question of why there are 
only four un-curled-up 
dimensions in our universe. 



In M-theory there is no 
overall rule that a universe 
must have four observable 
dimensions. Top-down 
cosmology says that there 
will be a range of possibilities 
that includes every number of 
large space dimensions from 
zero to ten. Three dimensions 
of space and one of time may 
not be the most probable 
situation, but that is the only 
sort of situation that is of 



interest to us. 

Considering the universe 
in the old way, from the 
'bottom up', there seems to 
be no discoverable reason 
why the laws of nature are 
what they are and not 
something different, why the 
universe is fine-tuned for our 
existence. But we do observe 
the laws of nature to be what 
they are, and we are here. 
Why not start with that? Our 



presence is hugely 
significant. Out of the 
enormous array of possible 
universes, our presence 
'selects' those universes that 
are compatible with our 
existence, and makes all the 
rest of them almost irrelevant 
(though we shall see about 
that as Hawking continues). 

With the no-boundary 
universe we no longer needed 
to ask how the universe 



began. There was no 
beginning. With M-theory we 
no longer need to ask why the 
universe is fine-tuned for our 
existence. It is our existence 
that 'chooses' the universe 
we live in. In effect, we fine- 
tune it ourselves. The 
anthropic principle has come 
to its full strength indeed. As 
Hawking puts it, 'Although 
we are puny and insignificant 
on the scale of the cosmos, 



this makes us in a sense the 
lords of creation. '- 

Now, the question arises: 
can we test this theory? 
Hawking writes that there 
may be measurements 
capable of differentiating the 
top-down theory from others, 
to support it or refute it. 
Perhaps future satellites can 
take such measurements. In 
his 2006 Caltech lecture, 
Hawking had mentioned the 



'new window on the very 
early universe' that the 
detection and measurement of 
gravitational waves would 
open for us. Unlike light, 
which was scattered many 
times by free electrons before 
freezing out when the 
universe was 380,000 years 
old, gravitational waves reach 
us from the earliest universe 
without interference from any 
intervening material.- 



Hawking extends top- 
down thinking to the 
emergence of intelligent life 
on Earth. He offers an 
eloquent account of the 
manner in which our 
universe, our solar system, 
and our world are incredibly 
fine-tuned to allow our 
existence, far far beyond any 
reasonable expectation. 
Nevertheless, in a restatement 
of the anthropic principle in a 



simple and unarguable way, 
he tells us that 'Obviously, 
when the beings on a planet 
that supports life examine the 
world around them, they are 
bound to find that their 
environment satisfies the 
conditions they require to 
exist. ' 7 Just as we, by the fact 
of our presence, choose our 
universe, we choose a history 
of this Earth and our cosmic 
environment that allows us to 



exist. 

In The Grand Design, 
Hawking seems no longer to 
entertain doubts that 
everything is determined. The 
information paradox, by 
whatever means it was 
banished, has ceased to be a 
bother. He states, 
unequivocally, that 'The 
scientific determinism that 
Laplace formulated is ... in 
fact, the basis of all modern 



science.'- That, of course, he 
had never called into 
question. His earlier 
suggestion, regarding the 
implications of information 
loss, was that all of modern 
science might be wrong. Such 
fears apparently have been 
put to rest, for he goes on to 
say that scientific 
determinism is 6 a principle 
that is important throughout 
this book'. 2 And, later, 'This 



book is rooted in the concept 
of scientific determinism.'— 

Scientific determinism 
applies to us humans too: 'It 
seems,' he writes, 'that we 
are no more than biological 
machines and that free will is 
just an illusion ... Since we 
cannot solve the equations 
that determine our behaviour, 
we use the effective theory 
that people have free will.'— 
We might wish Hawking had 



spent a little more time in the 
book with this issue. 
Important scientific work has 
taken place having to do with 
human free will - some of it 
supporting his view and some 
of it not - but Hawking does 
not discuss it. He has made 
his own choice. His comment 
that the world is in a mess 
because, 'as we all know, 
decisions are often not 
rational or are based on a 



defective analysis of the 
consequences of the choice', 
also leaves one wishing for 
more discussion. The 
comment comes across as 
uncharacteristically 'throw- 
away', compared with 
Hawking ' s thoughtful 
comments about the world 
situation in his lectures and 
public statements. 

Determinism turns out, 
however, to be a somewhat 



complicated concept and not 
as rigid as we might suppose. 
As we saw earlier in this 
book, on the quantum level of 
the universe we have to 
accept a somewhat revised 
version of determinism in 
which, given the state of a 
system at any one time, the 
laws of nature determine the 
probabilities of various 
different futures and pasts 
rather than dictating the 



future and past precisely. As 
Hawking puts it, 'Nature 
allows a number of different 
eventualities, each with a 
certain likelihood of being 
realized.'- You can test a 
quantum theory by repeating 
an experiment many times, 
noting how frequently 
different results occur and 
whether the frequency of 
their occurrence fits the 
probabilities the theory 



predicted. 

Hawking mentions again 
the ideas that he and I 
discussed in the old DAMTP 
common room back in 1996, 
ideas for which some people 
were criticizing him at that 
time. His words to me back 
then were 'We never have a 
model-independent view of 
reality. But that doesn't mean 
there is no model- 
independent reality. If I didn't 



think there is, I couldn't go 
on doing science.' Now, in 
The Grand Design, he writes, 
in italics for emphasis, ' There 
is no picture- or theory- 
independent concept oj 
reality.' He goes on to say 
that this is ' a conclusion that 
will be important in this 
book'. This statement 
rephrases the first part of his 
statement to me, substituting 
'concept' for 'view', but not 



the second part. We are left to 
wonder whether the rest still 
holds. 

Hawking lists two other 
ways of thinking about 
'reality' that he is rejecting. 
One is the 'realist' viewpoint 
of classical science based on 
the belief that a real, external 
world exists, a world that can 
be measured and analysed - 
that is the same for every 
observer who studies it. The 



other is what Hawking calls 
the 'anti-realist' viewpoint. 
This viewpoint is so insistent 
on confining itself to 
empirical knowledge gleaned 
through experiment and 
observation that it has little 
use for theory and ends up 
self-destructing with the 
notion that because anything 
we learn is filtered through 
our brains, we can't really 
count on there being such a 



thing as empirical knowledge. 

Hawking believes that his 
own 'model-dependent 
realism' makes the argument 
between realism and anti- 
realism unnecessary. He 
insists it is only meaningful to 
ask whether a model agrees 
with observation, not whether 
it is 'real'. If more than one 
model agrees with 
observation, you don't have 
to argue which is more 'real' 



or 'right'. 'Our perception - 
and hence the observations 
upon which our theories are 
based - is not direct, but 
rather is shaped by a kind of 
lens, the interpretive structure 
of our human brains.'- That 
goes for everyday experience, 
he says, not just in science. 
On that level too, whether we 
are consciously devising 
models or not, we never have 
a model-independent view of 



reality. Nevertheless, our 
model-dependent views of 
reality are not worthless. 
They are the way human 
beings come to understand 
and manage their world. 
Models stand and fall as they 
continue or cease to match 
observation and experience. 

It isn't difficult to agree 
with Hawking. Unless I am in 
a state of denial - which we 
all probably are in part, 



sometimes - I do make my 
learning-progress through life 
in precisely that way. You 
and I come from different sets 
of experiences. Perhaps we 
might be able to agree to 
disagree without making 
claims about who is 'right' 
and who is 'wrong'. Would 
Hawking go so far as to apply 
his philosophy to the more 
extreme views that divide our 
world? That, possibly, is 



where he would invoke 
something like the second, 
decidedly Platonic, part of his 
statement, perhaps to say, 
'But that does not mean there 
are no such things as "right" 
and "wrong"; if I didn't think 
there are, I couldn't go on 
living in any meaningful 
way.' On the other hand, 
there are claims that human 
values are products of our 
evolutionary history. In this 



way of thinking, 'right' is 
what has aided the survival of 
our species - nothing more 
profound or fundamental than 
that. If that is true (and what, 
after all, does 'truth' come 
down to in a discussion like 
this?), then model- 
independent morality is 
perhaps as illusive as model- 
independent reality. 

Be that as it may, 
Hawking 's discussion of 



'reality' helps with something 
you may have been 
wondering about since 
Chapter 2 . If no one has 
actually seen, for example, an 
electron, how do we know 
electrons are 'real'? 

Though it's true that no 
one has ever seen an electron, 
electrons are a useful 'model' 
that makes sense of 
observations of tracks in a 
cloud chamber or spots of 



light on a television tube. The 
model has been applied with 
enormous success in both 
fundamental science and 
engineering. But are electrons 
real? Though a great many 
physicists would say, yes, of 
course they are, that question 
according to Hawking is 
meaningless. 

'Model-dependent 
realism', as he calls it, is a 
useful way of thinking about 



dualities - those situations in 
which two different, perhaps 
mutually exclusive, 
descriptions are necessary to 
gain a better understanding 
than either description alone 
can provide. Neither theory is 
'better' or more 'real' than 
the other. Recall the most 
familiar example, wave- 
particle duality, which 
emerged in the early 
twentieth century with the 



discovery that when light 
interacts with matter it acts as 
though it must be particles, 
while experiments with the 
way light travels show that it 
acts as though it were waves. 

All of which brings us 
back to think more 
knowledge-ably about M- 
theory. As we've said, it 
appears that no mathematical 
model is able to describe 
every aspect of the universe. 



Each theory in the M-theory 
family can describe a certain 
range of phenomena. When 
these ranges overlap, the 
theories agree. In this manner 
they are all parts of the same 
theory, just as the smaller 
sections of the map in 
Hawking 's analogy were all 
parts of the same map. But no 
single theory in the family is 
capable of describing all the 
forces of nature and the 



particles that we mentioned in 
Chapter 2 . plus the 
framework of time and space 
where the universe game 
plays out. If this seemingly 
fragmented map is where the 
great quest must end, so be it, 
'it is acceptable within the 
framework of model- 
dependent reality'.- We have 
no more fundamental theory 
that we can claim is 
independent of the models we 



know. 

Hawking and Mlodinow 
write that all the universes in 
the multiverse were created 
out of nothing, arising 
naturally from physical law, 
and that they require no 
creator. They have 
oversimplified a bit to make 
their point. In eternal- 
inflation theory, which 
Hawking favours, universes 
don't arise from nothing. 



They arise from other 
universes. Somewhere in the 
past, there may have been a 
first universe and a first 
inflation sequence, where it 
all started off, or the 
repeating self-replication 
process may stretch back 
eternally into the past. 
Presumably the origin of that 
first universe (if there was a 
'first universe') can be 
explained by the no- 



boundary-proposal, which 
leaves us precisely where A 
Brief History of Time 
stopped, asking those same 
profound questions that left 
plenty of room for God. 

The Grand Design, 
however, addresses another 
puzzle, the fine-tuning 
mystery. Some who believe 
in God - still not warned off 
the God-of-the-Gaps theology 
which clings to instances 



where something seems 
unexplainable without God - 
will no doubt find it 
distressing that Hawking and 
Mlodinow have very 
successfully shown another 
plausible explanation, using 
the top-down method and 
multiverses. If you believe in 
God only as a necessary 
explanation, Hawking has 
once again cut you adrift. 
More interesting than the 



media attention Hawking 's 
books gain for God/science 
issues is the fact that, for 
careful, thoughtful readers, 
they do lead to some 
profound inner debates. 
Those don't always end the 
way Hawking might expect. 

In their final chapter, 
Hawking and Mlodinow 
address the question of where 
the physical laws come from, 
introducing the discussion 



with the following comment: 
'The laws of nature tell us 
how the universe behaves, but 
they don't answer why.' At 
the end of A Brief History oj 
Time Hawking had written 
that the answer to that 
question would be to know 
the mind of God. Now he has 
broken the question into three 
parts: 'Why this particular set 
of laws and not some other?', 
'Why is there something 



rather than nothing?' (the 
laws being part of the 
'something') and 'Why do we 
exist?' 

To help address the first 
of those questions, Hawking 
and Mlodinow list the laws 
that are necessary in a 
physical universe that looks 
like our own. They must be a 
set of laws that have a 
concept of energy in which 
the amount of energy is 



constant, not changing over 
time. Another requirement is 
that the laws must dictate that 
the energy of any isolated 
body surrounded by empty 
space will be positive. And 
there must be a law like 
gravity. The theory of this 
gravity must have 
supersymmetry between the 
forces of nature and the 
particles of matter they 
govern. Adopting the top- 



down method, the answer to 
'Why this particular set of 
laws and not some other?' 
can be simply 'Because any 
other set of laws would make 
it impossible for us to be here 
asking that question.' That 
would be an answer invoking 
the anthropic principle, but 
M-theory has a little more to 
say on the issue than that: 
because of all the different 
ways the extra dimensions 



curl up, with each universe 
having laws determined by 
how they curl in that 
universe, there will certainly 
be a universe around that has 
these laws. 

To help address the third 
of those questions ('Why do 
we exist?'), Hawking and 
Mlodinow introduce us to a 
computer game known as 
'The Game of Life'. It's a 
fascinating game, invented 



back in 1970 by John Horton 
Conway, then a Cambridge 
mathematician. The layout 
looks like a chessboard, with 
some squares 'alive' and 
some 'dead'. A very simple 
set of rules dictate 'deaths', 
'births' and 'survival' as the 
game moves from 'generation 
to generation'. It soon 
becomes evident that 
extremely simple rules can 
play out in very complicated 



ways. Remember the 'alien 
who has never experienced 
our universe' in Chapter 2 . 
Someone coming in on this 
game after it's been going a 
while will be in a similar 
position, able to deduce 
'laws' from what's going on, 
laws that seem to govern the 
formation and behaviour of 
elaborate groupings of the 
live and dead squares - laws 
that however are not among 



the simple original laws at all 
but that arise out of them. The 
game is a simple example of 
'emergent complexity' or 
'self-organizing systems'. It 
helps us comprehend, for 
example, how the stripes on a 
zebra or patterns on a flower 
petal occur from a tissue of 
cells growing together. 

Conway invented this 
game as an attempt to find 
out whether in a 'universe' 



with extremely simple 
fundamental rules, objects 
would emerge that were 
complex enough to replicate 
themselves. In the game, they 
do. They could even, in a 
sense, be thought of as 
'intelligent'. The bottom line 
is that a very simple set of 
laws is capable of producing 
complexity similar to that of 
intelligent life. In Hawking' s 
words, 'It is easy to imagine 



that slightly more 
complicated laws would 
allow complex systems with 
all the attributes of life.'— 
There is disagreement as to 
whether such life would be 
self-aware. 

That may seem to answer 
the question 'Why do we 
exist?' Is it a complete 
answer? In the Game of Life, 
it doesn't matter what pattern 
you start with - any 'initial 



conditions' will give you 
those same sorts of results - 
but not just any set of laws, 
because it is the laws that 
determine the evolution of the 
system. Which refers back to 
the first question: 'Why this 
particular set of laws and not 
some other?' 

Summing up so far, then, 
with regard to Hawking 's 
three questions, he and 
Mlodinow have answered the 



first ('Why this particular set 
of laws and not some other?') 
for our own universe with the 
idea that we have a particular 
set of laws because of the 
way the extra dimensions are 
curled up. Can they answer it 
for the overarching laws that 
govern the entire string 
theory landscape, the entire 
multiverse, the laws we do 
not yet know? They have said 
that of all the supersymmetric 



theories of gravity, M-theory 
is the most general, making it 
the only candidate for a 
complete theory of the 
universe. 'Candidate' it still 
is, awaiting proof, but 
Hawking believes it promises 
to be a model of a multiverse 
that includes us, because 
there is no other consistent 
model.— 

They have answered the 
third question ('Why do we 



exist?') by saying that, in the 
multitude of possible 
universes, a universe that 
allows for our existence is 
highly probable and, from 
there, even if there were only 
a very simple set of laws in 
place (dictated by the way the 
extra dimensions curl), it is 
not difficult to arrive at us 
(think of the game). 

The second of the 
questions ('Why is there 



something rather than 
nothing?') is more 
fundamental and much more 
difficult. An answer would 
have to account for much 
more than our universe, its 
laws and us. It would have to 
account for the very existence 
of the unknown theory that 
underlies the M-theory family 
of theories. Hawking thinks 
the multiverse ruled by this 
family of theories 'creates 



itself, but he does not 
explain how. Even the often- 
heard statement that 
'nothingness is unstable and 
tends to decay into 
something' implies that a 
certain set of probabilities 
must already be in place. This 
question - 'Why is there 
something rather than 
nothing?' - Hawking and 
Mlodinow have left 
unanswered. 



Though many of 
Hawking 's colleagues have 
high hopes indeed for M- 
theory, few join him in his 
enormous optimism about its 
total explanatory power. 
There were questions that 
hung in the air at the close of 
A Brief History of Time, 
eloquently stated, evoking 
grand hopes that we might 
some day solve these 
mysteries. The attempt 



actually to answer all of them 
in The Grand Design falls 
short. 

Critics of the book were 
not enthusiastic, and their 
lack of enthusiasm seemed 
based not on disagreement 
with the authors but on 
disappointment that this was 
not a more powerful book. 
The Economist commented 
that 'whenever the going 
threatens to get tough, the 



authors retreat into hand- 
waving and move briskly 
on'— ... 'There are actually 
rather a lot of questions that 
are more subtle than the 
authors think.'— As for the 
claim that the ideas presented 
in the book have passed every 
experimental test to which 
they have been put, that is 
'misleading' ... 'It is the bare 
bones of quantum mechanics 
that have proved to be 



consistent with what is 
presently known of the sub- 
atomic world. The authors' 
interpretations and 
extrapolations of it have not 
been subjected to any 
decisive tests, and it is not 
clear that they ever could 
be.'— Dwight Garner, in The 
New York Times, wrote that 
'the real news about "The 
Grand Design" is how 
disappointingly tinny and 



inelegant it is. The spare and 
earnest voice that Mr. 
Hawking employed with such 
appeal in "A Brief History of 
Time" has been replaced here 
by one that is alternately 
condescending, as if he were 
Mr. Rogers explaining rain 
clouds to toddlers, and 
impenetrable.' Garner also 
accused Hawking of 
'Godmongering', as the 
writer Timothy Ferris has 



called it, when an author who 
is not religious makes 
statements about God and 
religious belief solely to sell 
books.- 

There is nothing 
disappointing or feeble, 
however, about the 'top- 
down' approach and 
Hawking 's and Mlodinow's 
presentation of M-theory. 
Hawking 's statement about 
their implications for the 



study of science is one of the 
best passages in the book. 
Hawking believes we are: 



at a critical point in 
the history of science, 
in which we must 
alter our conception of 
goals and of what 
makes a physical 
theory acceptable. It 
appears that the 
fundamental numbers, 



and even the form, of 
the apparent laws of 
nature are not 
demanded by logic or 
physical principle. 
The parameters are 
free to take on any 
values and the laws to 
take on any form that 
leads to a self- 
consistent 

mathematical theory, 
and they do take on 



different values and 
different forms in 
different universes. 
That may not satisfy 
our human desire to 
be special or to 
discover a neat 
package to contain all 
the laws of physics, 
but it does seem to be 
the way of nature. - 



What does it mean for 



banishing belief in God? The 
disparagement of belief in 
The Grand Design is much 
more frequent and assertive 
than in Hawking 's other 
books. But the more grand 
the design becomes - and 
Hawking 's is a spectacularly 
grand design - the more those 
readers who find Hawking 's 
science convincing and also 
believe in God are bound to 
find cause for wonder in the 



elegant complexity of the 
multiverse vision. 

The religious discussion, 
sometimes heated, erupted as 
soon as the book reached 
reviewers and the public. 
Perusing all that, one is 
surprised to find how many of 
the discussants, coming from 
both viewpoints, clearly have 
not read Hawking 's and 
Mlodinow's book. Among 
those who have, it is perhaps 



not so surprising to find 
atheists who nevertheless do 
not feel that Hawking and 
Mlodinow succeed in 
banishing the need for a 
creator, and theists who think 
he has done a pretty thorough 
job of it. It seems that one's 
atheism or theism can remain 
essentially untouched by 
Hawking ' s arguments, 
perhaps because such choices 
are very often based on 



reasons that have nothing to 
do with science. Among those 
who disagree with Hawking, 
the most interesting 
arguments take two forms. 

(1) In spite of the hugely 
comprehensive explanatory 
power of Hawking 's model - 
and even if this should some 
day turn out to be model- 
independent reality a 
question that is as old as 
human thought is still left 



hanging: why is there 
something - a grand design - 
rather than nothing? The 
'something' in the M-theory 
model is far, far grander and 
more extensive than has ever 
been proposed before. But 
why is there anything to have 
a model of? Granted, a 
religious answer to that 
question, 'God', does no 
better than a scientific one 
which argues that 'There is a 



fundamental mathematical 
logic that does not allow 
"nothing"'. 'God' and 
'mathematical logic' are both, 
indeed, 'something', so both 
prompt a question: who 
created God? Who set down 
the mathematical logic? 

You might expect 
Hawking to say that we, the 
observers, are the answer. 
Where the buck stops. No 
need to ask who or what 



created us. We are here. Our 
presence 'chooses' that all the 
rest of it exists. No other 
argument is possible or 
needed. 

Hawking does not use 
that argument. Not in his 
book, nor when he and I 
spoke in his office in 
November 2010. I mentioned 
the question he had posed in 
A Brief History of Time: 
'What is it that breathes fire 



into the equations and makes 
a universe for them to 
describe?' Using top-down 
thinking, might the answer be 
- us?, I asked. His reply was 
'No.' 

(2) The second argument 
relies on the idea of 'model- 
dependent reality'. Those 
who present this argument 
point out that Hawking and 
Mlodinow have written that 
each of us has a personal 



model of the world that fits 
our life experience and 
attempts to make sense of it. 
Our models will in many 
ways be the same, but not in 
all ways, because our 
experiences are different. 
Hawking 's model does not 
have to include any 
experience of the presence 
and power of God. He has 
evidently had no experience 
of that and no reports of it 



from people he considers 
reliable. Why should he make 
it part of his model? He has 
no need of it. 

On the other hand, for 
someone who has had 
experience of the presence 
and power of God, 
Hawking 's model is 
inadequate. Their model must 
include that experience. (And 
if you've already decided 
such experience can't be 



'real', then you're already 
violating the tenets of 
'model-dependent reality' 
and should leave this 
discussion.) Suppose that in 
addition to having experience 
of God you agree with 
Hawking 's science. Perhaps 
you are a physicist. Then 
your model will also have to 
include not only God but all 
the amazing findings and 
speculations of twentieth-and 



twenty- first-century 
scientists. Are you in trouble? 

Luckily, a model that 
includes both belief in God 
and in science has not been 
ruled out by either A Brief 
History of Time or The Grand 
Design. It is possible and not 
crazy, at least according to 
many of Hawking 's 
colleagues, and both theists 
and atheists who have entered 
the debate. Read The Grand 



Design carefully and with an 
open mind, and you will 
probably agree that is so. We 
have, then, two different 
models, one with God and 
one without. According to 
'model-dependent reality', it 
is meaningless even to ask 
whether one is more 'real' 
than the other, and 
inconsistent for Hawking to 
be so sure that his Godless- 
universe model represents 



'reality'. 

You may be thinking that 
it is not appropriate to apply 
model-dependent reality to 
our personal world-views, but 
Hawking seems to think it is 
when he states: 

Our brains interpret 
the input from our 
sensory organs by 
making a model of the 
outside world. We 



form mental concepts 
of our home, trees, 
other people, the 
electricity that flows 
from wall sockets, 
atoms, molecules and 
other universes. These 
mental concepts are 
the only reality we 
can know. There is no 
model-independent 
test of reality.- 



Undeniably our models will 
include more than these 
physical attributes of the 
universe. They will, as we've 
said, include convictions of 
what is right and what is 
wrong. In an extreme case: 
are we required to respect a 
'model' created through a 
lens of hatred, selfishness and 
prejudice? We know from 
Hawking 's public statements 
regarding human rights and 



politics that at least on a 
practical level he does not 
extend model-dependent 
reality to include model- 
dependent morality. 

In My Mind I am 
Free 

When Stephen Hawking and I 
were first discussing my 
plans for this book in 
November 2010, he asked me 



to be sure to include his latest 
ideas about eternal inflation 
and the observations he 
suggests could help verify it. 
You read about that in 
Chapter 19 . His second 
request was that I not fail to 
mention his new television 
series that would be shown in 
the UK early in 2011. It is a 
three-part documentary 
called, in Britain, Stephen 
Hawking 's Universe (using 



the same title as an earlier 
series) and, in the USA, Into 
the Universe with Stephen 
Hawking. 

This time it is not from a 
lecture hall or his office that 
Hawking invites us to join 
him on an adventure through 
time and space, but from the 
Hall of his college, Gonville 
and Caius. The long wooden 
tables have been pushed back 
against the walls. Hawking 



sits in his wheelchair, alone 
in the splendid wood-panelled 
room. His portrait can be seen 
on the wall along with 
portraits of other college 
luminaries of the past and 
present. In the familiar voice, 
he begins: 'Hello. My name 
is Stephen Hawking: 
physicist, cosmologist and 
something of a dreamer. 
Although I cannot move, and 
I have to speak through a 



computer, in my mind I am 
free.'- That proves to be 
abundantly correct as we 
voyage with him far out into 
the universe, in time and 
space, to encounter the 
wonders he knows or has 
good reason to believe are 
there, and into his own 
imagination to find the 
landscapes and creatures he 
thinks we might find. In this 
spectacularly filmed triptych, 



Hawking, and those 
responsible for the state-of- 
the-art computer animation 
and astronomy photography, 
succeed in evoking a chilling 
awareness of the enormous 
distances and numberless 
galaxies the sheer, 

stupefying, inconceivable 
vastness of space and time. 

Hawking doesn't narrate 
the series himself. Even 
before his introductory 



sentence ends, the voice has 
seamlessly shifted to the 
voice of Benedict 
Cumberbatch, the actor who 
played the young Stephen 
Hawking in the film 
Hawking. Occasionally 
Hawking 's own voice comes 
back for a few seconds, and 
so does the scene in the Hall 
of Caius, just to remind us 
who's really telling the tale. 
For the first of the trilogy, 



the animators and Hawking 
have invented fantastic 
extraterrestrials, a few of 
whom he should shoot down 
immediately with his rocket- 
launcher if they ever appear 
in his office - never mind the 
Prime Directive. Although 
Hawking insists that the best 
place to look if we want to 
enquire about life in our 
universe is here at home, 
where there exists the only 



known life, he does lead us 
far beyond Earth and the solar 
system and our own galaxy. 
He tells us that there may be 
life in the cosmos so strange 
that we wouldn't recognize it 
as life. And we hear, with a 
shudder, that it isn't 'what 
they're like but what they can 
do that counts': for instance, 
arrive in swarms of 
advanced-technology 
spacecraft and within a few 



seconds pirate all the energy 
of the sun by encasing it with 
mirrors, focusing that energy 
to create a wormhole. And 
yes, when it comes to 
wormholes, Hawking is back 
in that game, no matter how 
discouraging some of his 
recent statements have been 
about them. It might indeed 
be possible for a very 
advanced civilization to 
create one. Is all of this 



highly unlikely? Perhaps, but 
Hawking ends by reminding 
us of what we learned earlier 
in the show about our own 
improbable emergence here 
on Earth: 'We only have to 
look at ourselves to know that 
extremely unlikely things can 
and do happen all the time.'- 
In 'Time Travel', the 
second of the trilogy, 
Hawking admits to being 
'obsessed by time'. He is 



particularly curious about 
'how our whole cosmic story 
ends'. This segment is a tour- 
de-force overview of the 
possibility of time travel. 
Tiny wormholes through 
space and time constantly 
form and re-form, linking 
separate spaces and separate 
times. Could one be captured 
and enlarged many trillions of 
times and used as a time 
machine? Is travel to the past 



by this or any other means 
possible? Hawking has 
printed an invitation, copies 
of which he hopes might 
survive several thousand 
years, laid out champagne 
and delicious-looking food, 
and hung a banner, 
'Welcome, Reception for 
Future Time Travellers'. His 
invitation gives all the 
necessary information and 
coordinates required to find 



him and share this feast. No 
guests arrive. Perhaps none of 
the invitations survived long 
enough, but in a Cambridge 
college, at least one or two of 
them probably would. 
Because no one responds to 
his invitation, and for other 
reasons, such as a 
'fundamental rule that 
governs the entire universe' 
that cause happens before 
effect, unsolvable paradoxes, 



and the inevitable radiation 
feedback that would destroy a 
wormhole before you could 
use it, Hawking concludes 
that we cannot travel to the 
past. But we can to the future, 
and we needn't depend on 
wormholes. Einstein realized 
that time doesn't flow at the 
same rate everywhere, and 
it's a well-established fact 
that he was right. Matter 
drags on time, slowing it 



down, and that means a 
massive body can serve as a 
time machine. A spacecraft 
flying near the event horizon 
of a super-massive black 
hole, with skilful enough 
navigation and sufficient 
speed not to fall in, would 
make a noticeable jump 
forward in time. After about 
five years (in your personal 
time) at the black hole, you 
could find that ten years had 



passed on Earth. Travelling 
near the speed of light would 
work much better, though the 
same slowing of time that 
makes this a quicker way to 
get to the future also makes it 
impossible to travel at or 
above the speed of light. 
Passengers travelling near 
light speed (in a wonderfully 
conceived train that must 
circumnavigate the Earth 
seven times a second) could 



return after only a week 
measured in their own 
personal time, to find the 
world had moved forward by 
a hundred years. 

The third segment of the 
trilogy is a genuine climax to 
the series. First, Hawking 
takes us to the early universe 
to observe the Big Bang. He 
admits that it would all have 
been completely dark, 
because light didn't exist yet 



- so you couldn't actually see 
it. Space didn't exist either. 
There was no 'outside' this 
event from which to view it. 
'All that there was was 
inside.'- We journey through 
the inflation era, witness the 
annihilation of matter and 
antimatter with the whole 
future of the universe hanging 
on there being just a 
minuscule bit more matter 
than antimatter, and learn the 



enormous significance of the 
force of gravity again and 
again in creating the universe 
we know. We see Wheeler's 
democracy vividly 
demonstrated as a load of 
ball-bearings roll through the 
doors into the Hall of Caius. 
Animation takes over to show 
them all perfectly equidistant 
from one another, forming a 
gridlock that would never 
have yielded to make 'our' 



universe. But remove just a 
handful of the ball bearings, 
one here, one there, from the 
perfect pattern, and gravity 
gets a foothold - another 
example, Hawking points out, 
of how imperfection is 
absolutely necessary in our 
universe. Eventually we do 
get to the universe as we 
know it, and beyond. 
Hawking takes us into the 
future, and he is a truly 



amazing 'futurist'. His plea is 
eloquent in support of 
colonizing other planets, and 
his vision for Earth 
harrowing. He is still as 
concerned as he was in his 
youth about the hazard of 
nuclear weapons - 'We are 
clever enough to design such 
things, but I'm not sure we 
are clever enough not to use 
them'— - but some of the 
other possibilities are even 



more likely to cause 
nightmares. He also admits 
that there are staggering 
obstacles we will encounter 
in finding another home in 
the universe. 

What about the question 
of how our whole cosmic 
story ends? 'The fate of the 
universe,' he tells us, 
'depends on how dark energy 
behaves.'- Is it increasing? 
Will it continue to push space 



apart, driving the expansion? 
Will all the particles 
eventually be so far apart that 
nothing at all can happen? Or 
might dark energy's strength 
diminish, allowing gravity to 
pull everything together again 
in a Big Crunch? We don't 
know. That end is a very long 
way off. Hawking says that 
on one of his trips to Japan he 
was requested not to mention 
the fate of the universe lest it 



upset the stock market, but he 
thinks it would be premature 
to sell up. Hawking' s 
suggestion for survival at that 
extremely distant time is that 
we might find out how to 
travel to another universe. We 
have about thirty billion years 
to work out how to do that. 

In Into the Universe with 
Stephen Hawking, Hawking 
chooses not to disparage 
belief in God directly. After a 



stunning series of sequences 
that show many turning 
points in the history of the 
universe where it could so 
easily have gone wrong, and 
overwhelming us with the 
sheer grandeur and elegant 
genius of it all, he says, in his 
own voice: 'Perhaps science 
has revealed there is some 
higher authority at work, 
setting the laws of nature so 
that our universe and we can 



exist. So is there a grand 
designer, who lined up all the 
good fortune? In my opinion, 
not necessarily.'— And he 
goes on to talk about the 
anthropic principle and the 
possibility of many different 
kinds of universes. His goal 
seems to be to lay out what 
we know, and what we 
surmise, and what his opinion 
is, and to make his audience 
as excited, awed and curious 



about the universe as he is. 
From there, we're on our 
own. He even contradicts the 
claim made in the subtitle of 
The Grand Design, that we 
know the ultimate answers. In 
the final moments of the 
documentary, he says, 'Some 
day we may solve the 
ultimate mystery ... discover 
why the universe exists at 
all.'— Into the Universe with 
Stephen Hawking leaves us 



not only awed by the 
universe, but also agape at 
ourselves, us creatures who 
have actually managed to 
discover and understand so 
astonishingly much. But there 
still remains that question. 
Errol Morris, director of the 
film A Brief History of Time, 
said there was a challenge he 
always set himself when he 
made a film: 'To extract a 
situation's truth without 



violating its mystery. ' 
Hawking has met that 
challenge. 

This magnificent trilogy, 
with a splendid musical score, 
is perhaps close to the dream 
that was not realized in the 
film of A Brief History of 
Time, in spite of Morris's 
skills. It is probably what 
Hawking originally hoped 
that film would be like, 
except that in twenty-five 



years computer animation has 
vastly improved, and the 
dream itself has grown 
exponentially. 

2010-2011 

Before I began writing this 
book, I went to visit Hawking 
in his office in November 
2010 for the first time in 
several years. The room had 
changed only a little. The 
large picture of Marilyn was 



not on the wall but, 
inexplicably, lying on the 
floor. The photographs of 
Lucy's boy William were still 
there on the shelves, and 
there was also a small colour 
photo of Hawking and Elaine 
lying among other papers 
near his computer screen. On 
the end of his desk nearest the 
door was a mysterious 
arrangement of stones in a 
large flat dish, emitting a 



faint vapour that seems to 
have no smell, unusual in that 
it emerges from the stones in 
flat, wing-like gauzy clouds 
that look as though they have 
a tiny hem at the edge. Judith 
Croasdell, Hawking' s 

personal assistant, explained 
that it is a special kind of 
humidifier, chosen several 
years ago by Elaine, that 
makes it easier for Hawking 
to breathe. The liquid 



required for it is not ordinary 
water, and a large supply of 
bottles takes up a good part of 
the storage space under the 
side window. Outside that 
window is the 'pavilion' that 
was not yet built in 2000, but 
it doesn't spoil the view. The 
office has a tranquil, happy 
feeling to it. 

My conversation with 
Hawking took place as usual 
with both of us sitting behind 



his desk facing his computer 
screen. Hawking was 
controlling the cursor on the 
screen by moving his cheek 
muscle. A small electronic 
beep came from the 
contraption attached to the 
back of his chair when he 
made a choice on the screen. 

The computer program on 
the screen looked the same, 
but he also has the option of 
using another program. I 



could not tell how he was 
making the word choices on 
that one, and, in fact, it didn't 
seem to be operating very 
well for him. His writing 
speed had slowed down 
considerably. I was told that 
if the cheek or eye movement 
ceases to work there are other 
possibilities, including direct 
connections to the brain. He 
will deal with that if and 
when it becomes absolutely 



necessary. Not every bit of 
communication requires the 
computer. If he raises his 
eyebrows, that means yes. 
Mouth down means no. You 
can still tell when he is 
smiling. Hawking recently 
had surgery for cataracts and 
probably doesn't even really 
need to wear glasses now, but 
still does. 

During our conversation 
the window blinds suddenly 



went down by themselves as 
it got darker outside. I had 
forgotten that such things 
happen automatically in this 
ultra-sophisticated building. 
The nurses changed shift. The 
one whose shift was ending - 
a dignified, gentle woman - 
came over and said goodbye 
to him without expecting a 
reply. 

Whenever I talk with 
Stephen Hawking I try to 



phrase my questions in ways 
that allow him to answer with 
a simple yes or no, though he 
usually goes on to elaborate 
anyway. That afternoon I was 
particularly interested in 
asking him about what 
seemed a possible change in 
his views about independent 
reality (reflected in The 
Grand Design) since we 
discussed that in 1996. I 
quoted him the words he had 



used back then: 'We never 
have a model-independent 
view of reality. But that 
doesn't mean there is no 
model-independent reality. If 
I didn't think there is, I 
couldn't go on doing 
science.' I asked him whether 
he would change that now to 
say, 'Independent reality is 
that there is no independent 
reality.' His answer was 'I 
still think there is an 



underlying reality, it is just 
that our picture of it is model- 
dependent.' - 

A Swipe at 
Immortality 

In an interview in the 
Guardian— and a lecture at a 
'Google Zeitgeist' meeting in 
London in the spring of 201 1, 
Hawking bluntly revealed 
part of his own personal 



picture of reality. His 
headlined words were 'There 
is no heaven or afterlife ... 
that is a fairy story for people 
afraid of the dark.' Hawking 
was, of course, expressing an 
opinion regarding something 
about which no one, 
including himself, has any 
scientifically provable 
knowledge whatsoever either 
for or against, but he 
explained his position by 



stating his own view of the 
human brain. One school of 
thought among researchers 
who study the brain sees the 
brain as a computer and the 
'mind' as nothing more than a 
product of it, and Hawking 
apparently had decided to 
join this club. 'I regard the 
brain,' he said, 'as a computer 
which will stop working 
when its components fail. 
There is no heaven or afterlife 



for broken-down computers.' 
Ergo, no heaven or afterlife 
for us. 

In reply to the interview 
question 'How should we 
live?', Hawking said, 'We 
should seek the greatest value 
of our action. ' 

There were, not 
surprisingly, numerous 
responses to Hawking 's 
interview. Although some 
read it as a declaration of 



atheism, others pointed out 
that his statement was about 
belief in human immortality, 
not about belief in God. Not 
everyone who believes there 
is a God also believes in 
heaven or an afterlife. Other 
readers noted that it is often 
possible to transfer the entire 
intellectual content of a 
computer to a new computer 
or even a 'memory stick' as 
an old computer dies, and 



asked facetiously whether this 
might represent a sort of 
transmigration of the soul. 

The Guardian printed one 
thoughtful response in full, 
even though it was longer 
than the original interview 
article itself.- The 
respondent, Michael 
Wenham, like Hawking, has 
ALS. 'For someone "facing 
the prospect of an early 
death",' Wenham wrote, 



'with probably an unpleasant 
prelude, the idea of extinction 
holds no more fear than sleep. 
It really is insulting to accuse 
me of believing there might 
be life after death because 
I'm afraid of the dark.' 
Wenham called Hawking 's 
statement 'both sad and 
misinformed. Openness to the 
theoretical possibility of there 
being 11 dimensions and 
fundamental particles "as yet 



undiscovered" shows an 
intellectual humility strangely 
at odds with writing off the 
possibility of other 
dimensions of existence.' 

Wenham ended his 
response: 'I can't prove it of 
course, but on good grounds 
I'd stake my life on it, that 
beyond death will be another 
great adventure; but first I 
have to finish this one.' 

Perhaps Stephen Hawking 



is up for another bet? 



Going On 

Hawking currently has two 
graduate students, and he still 
holds court in the common 
room at teatime, for there is 
now a common room only a 
short distance from 
Hawking' s office door, 
around the curve in the 
corridor, past the lift. A sign 
over the entrance reads 



Totter Room', but officially 
it is the 'Centre for 
Theoretical Cosmology' and 
is used not only at teatime but 
for meetings, lectures and 
conferences. The room is 
large and pleasant, with low 
tables, chairs and a counter 
for serving food and 
beverages in one corner, 
dimly lit as the common room 
in Silver Street was for most 
of the day. Large black chalk- 



boards - something the old 
common room lacked - cover 
a good part of two walls. I 
have never seen them without 
equations scribbled on them. 
In one corner of the room a 
bust of Hawking the 
Director of Research for the 
Centre - stands on a plinth. It 
is a splendid likeness by the 
sculptor Ian Walters. 

Hawking still lives in the 
large house that he built for 



himself and Elaine. He still 
goes often to concerts and the 
opera, especially Wagner - 
Tannhduser planned for the 
next week at Covent Garden, 
when I visited him in 
November - though he hasn't 
been to Bayreuth recently. He 
still travels, when possible by 
private jet. In January 2011, 
he was once again at Caltech. 
When he attended a play in 
Los Angeles, 33 Variations, 



in which Jane Fonda 
portrayed a musicologist in 
the early stages of ALS, 
Fonda seemed, in news 
reports, as thrilled to meet 
him as many fans would be to 
meet Jane Fonda. In March 
201 1, 1 had to rush to get a set 
of questions to Hawking 
before he headed back across 
the Atlantic to a conference at 
'Cook's Branch' near 
Houston, Texas, a rural 



conference centre in a nature 
reserve where physicists from 
around the world gather 
yearly for meetings, eager to 
see one another, eager to sink 
their teeth into theoretical 
questions that leave the rest 
of us gaping, eager to rough it 
a bit, sleeping in bungalows 
with lazily turning ceiling 
fans. 

In Cambridge, and when 
he visits Seattle or Arizona, 



where Lucy spends part of 
her time, Hawking 's family - 
now including three 
grandchildren (Lucy ' s 

William, and Robert and 
Katrina's two children), and 
Jane and Jane's husband 
Jonathan - are comfortable 
with him. There is the new 
closeness to Lucy that 
developed when they wrote 
their books together. In an 
interview in April 2011, 



Hawking was asked, if time 
travel were possible, what 
moment in his own past he 
would revisit, what was the 
best moment of all. His 
answer was: ' I would go back 
to 1967, and the birth of my 
first child, Robert. My three 
children have brought me 
great joy.'— His mother 
Isobel, at the time of writing, 
is still alive, well into her 
nineties, and still orders him 



about occasionally. She has 
said, frankly: 

Not all the things 
Stephen says probably 
are to be taken as 
gospel truth. He's a 
searcher, he is looking 
for things. And if 
sometimes he may 
talk nonsense, well, 
don't we all? The 
point is, people must 



think, they must go on 
thinking, they must 
try to extend the 
boundaries of 
knowledge; yet they 
don't sometimes even 
know where to start. 
You don't know 
where the boundaries 
are, do you?- 



John Wheeler called those 
boundaries, those frontiers 



not just of science but of 
human knowledge, 'the 
flaming ramparts of the 
world'. And, yes, we do 
know where those are. Not 
only somewhere out there in 
the distance. They fill our 
world. 

As Hawking has said 
about his own adventures on 
the ramparts: 



With hindsight it 



might appear that 
there had been a grand 
and premeditated 
design to address the 
outstanding problems 
concerning the origin 
and evolution of the 
universe. But it was 
not really like that. I 
did not have a master 
plan; rather I followed 
my nose and did 
whatever looked 



interesting and 
possible at the time.- 



Stephen Hawking 
returned to Cambridge from 
Texas and Arizona - where 
he had been visiting Lucy and 
William - in mid- April 2011, 
on the day I finished writing 
this book. Joan Godwin went 
over to cook him something 
to eat. His office was all set 
for him, the stones were 



emitting their vapour. 'The 
Boss' was back, ready to go 
on with his adventures as 
long as his health and his 
ability to communicate hold 
out ... a child who has never 
grown up . . . still asking how 
and why questions 
occasionally finding an 
answer that satisfies him ... 
for a while.

Glossary 



anthropic principle The 

idea that the answer to the 
question 'Why is the 
universe, as we find it, so 
suitable for our 
existence?' is that if it 
were different, we could 
not be here to ask the 
question, 
antimatter Matter consisting 



of antiparticles. 
antip article For every type 
of particle there exists an 
antiparticle with opposite 
properties, such as the sign 
of its electrical charge (for 
example, the electron has 
negative electrical charge; 
the antielectron, or 
positron, has positive 
electrical charge), and 
other qualities that we 
haven't dealt with in this 



book. However, the 
antiparticles of photons 
and gravitons are the same 
as the particles, 
arbitrary element 
Something which isn't 
predicted in a theory but 
must be learned from 
observation. For example, 
an alien who had never 
seen our universe couldn't 
take any theory we have 
so far and use it to work 



out what the masses and 
charges are of the 
elementary particles. 
These are arbitrary 
elements in the theories. 

Big Bang singularity A 
singularity at the 
beginning of the universe. 

Big Bang theory The theory 
which says that the 
universe began in a state 
of enormous density and 
pressure and exploded 



outwards and expanded 
until it is as we see it 
today, 
black hole A region of 
spacetime shaped like a 
sphere (or a slightly 
bulged-out sphere in the 
case of a rotating black 
hole) which cannot be 
seen by distant observers 
because gravity there is so 
strong that no light (or 
anything else) can escape 



from it. Black holes may 
form from the collapse of 
massive stars. This was 
the 'classical' definition of 
a black hole. Hawking 
showed that a black hole 
does radiate energy and 
may not be entirely 
'black'. (See also 
primordial black hole .) 
boson Particle with spin 
expressed in whole 
numbers. The messenger 



particles of the forces 
(gluons, W + , W", Z°, 
photons and gravitons) are 
bosons, 
boundary conditions What 
the universe was like at 
the instant of beginning, 
before any time 
whatsoever had passed. 
Also what it is like at any 
other 'edge' of the 
universe - the end of the 
universe, for example, or 



the centre of a black hole, 
classical physics Physics 

that doesn't take quantum 

mechanics into account, 
conservation of energy The 

law of science that says 

that energy (or its 

equivalent in mass) cannot 

be either created or 

destroyed, 
cosmological arrow of time 

The direction of time in 

which the universe is 



expanding, 
cosmological constant 

Albert Einstein introduced 
a 'cosmological constant', 
to counteract gravity, into 
his theory of general 
relativity. Without it, the 
theory predicted that the 
universe ought to be either 
expanding or collapsing, 
neither of which Einstein 
believed to be true. He 
later called it 'the greatest 



blunder of my life'. We 
now use the term to mean 
the energy density of the 
vacuum. 

cosmology The study of the 
very large and of the 
universe as a whole. 

dark energy The mysterious 
energy that makes up 
about 73 per cent of the 
universe and is thought to 
be responsible for the 
current acceleration of the 



universe's expansion. 

determinism The idea that 
the future is completely 
predictable from the 
present, completely 
determined by the present. 

Einstein's general theory of 
relativity (1915) The 
theory of gravity in which 
gravity is explained as a 
curvature in four- 
dimensional spacetime 
caused by the presence of 



mass or energy. It 
provides a set of equations 
that determine how much 
curvature is generated by 
any given distribution of 
mass or energy. It is a 
theory that we use to 
describe gravity at the 
level of the very large. 
Einstein's special theory of 
relativity (1905) 
Einstein's new view of 
space and time. The theory 



is based on the idea that 
the laws of science should 
be the same for all freely 
moving observers, no 
matter what their speed. 
The speed of light remains 
unchanged, no matter 
what the velocity of the 
observer measuring it is. 
electromagnetic force One 
of the four fundamental 
forces of nature. It causes 
electrons to orbit the 



nuclei of atoms. At our 
level it shows up as light 
and as all other 
electromagnetic radiation, 
such as radio waves, 
microwaves, X-rays and 
gamma rays. The 
messenger particle (boson) 
of the electromagnetic 
force is the photon, 
electromagnetic interaction 
The interaction in which 
an electron emits a photon 



and another electron 
absorbs it. 
electromagnetic radiation 

All forms of radiation that 
make up the 

electromagnetic spectrum, 
such as radio waves, 
microwaves, visible light, 
X-rays and gamma rays. 
All electromagnetic 
radiation is made up of 
photons, 
electroweak theory A 



theory developed in the 
1960s by Abdus Salam at 
Imperial College, London, 
and Steven Weinberg and 
Sheldon Glashow at 
Harvard which unified the 
electromagnetic force and 
the weak force, 
elementary particle A 
particle that we believe is 
not made up of anything 
smaller and that cannot be 
divided. 



entropy The measurement of 
the amount of disorder in a 
system. The second law of 
thermodynamics states 
that entropy always 
increases, never decreases. 
The universe as a whole, 
or any isolated system, can 
never become more 
orderly. 

escape velocity The speed 
necessary to escape the 
gravity of a massive body 



such as the Earth and 
escape to elsewhere in 
space. Escape velocity for 
the Earth is about 7 miles 
(11 kilometres) per 
second. Escape velocity 
for a black hole is slightly 
greater than the speed of 
light. 

event A point in spacetime, 
specified by its position in 
time and space, as on a 
spacetime diagram. 



event horizon The boundary 
of a black hole; the radius 
where escape velocity 
becomes greater than the 
speed of light. It is marked 
by hovering photons, 
which (moving at the 
speed of light) cannot 
escape and also cannot be 
drawn into the black hole. 
Light emitted inside it is 
drawn down into the black 
hole. To calculate the 



radius at which the event 
horizon forms, multiply 
the solar mass of the black 
hole (the same as for the 
star that collapsed to form 
it, unless that star lost 
mass earlier in the 
collapse) by 2 for miles or 
3 for kilometres. Thus, a 
10-solar-mass black hole 
has its event horizon at a 
radius of 20 miles or 30 
kilometres. You can see 



that if the mass changes, 
the radius where the event 
horizon is will also 
change, and the black hole 
will change in size, 
fermion For the purposes of 
this book you need to 
know that particles of 
ordinary matter (the 
particles in an atom, such 
as electrons, neutrons and 
protons) belong to a class 
of particles called 



fermions, and, like all 
fermions, they exchange 
messenger particles. A 
more technical definition 
of a fermion is a particle 
with half-integer spin 
which obeys the Pauli 
exclusion principle. We 
have not dealt with the 
exclusion principle in this 
book. 

forces of nature The four 
basic ways that particles 



can interact with one 
another. They are, in order 
from strongest to weakest, 
the strong force, the weak 
force, the electromagnetic 
force and the gravitational 
force. 

fractal A geometric pattern 
in which parts of the 
pattern repeat when 
viewed at any scale. 

frequency For a photon, the 
rate at which the 



electromagnetic field 
associated with the photon 
changes. For the purposes 
of this book, all you need 
to know is that the higher 
the frequency, the greater 
the energy of the photon. 

gamma rays 

Electromagnetic radiation 
of very short wavelengths. 

gluon The messenger 
particle which carries the 
strong force from one 



quark to another and 
causes the quarks to hold 
together in protons and 
neutrons in the nucleus of 
the atom. Gluons also 
interact with one another, 
grandfather paradox The 
idea that someone could 
travel back in time and 
prevent their grandparents 
from giving birth to their 
parents, thus preventing 
their own birth. 



gravitational force One of 

the four fundamental 
forces of nature, and also 
the weakest. Gravity 
usually attracts (but not 
during inflation), and can 
work over extremely long 
distances, 
gravitational radius 
Photons cannot escape 
from a black hole to the 
outside universe from 
within this radius. You can 



think of it in the same way 
as the event horizon, 
though the two terms are 
used differently. To 
calculate roughly what this 
radius will be, multiply the 
solar mass of the black 
hole by 2 for miles and 3 
for kilometres. Thus a 10- 
solar-mass black hole will 
have a radius of 20 miles 
or 30 kilometres, 
graviton The messenger 



particle which carries the 
gravitational force among 
all particles in the 
universe, including 
gravitons themselves. 
None has ever been 
directly observed. 

gravity See gravitational 
force 

Hawking radiation 

Radiation produced by a 
black hole when quantum 
effects are taken into 



account. You can think of 
it as a type of virtual 
particle pair production 
near the event horizon of a 
black hole in which one of 
the two falls into the hole, 
allowing the other to 
escape into space. 
Heisenberg uncertainty 
principle In quantum 
mechanics, it is impossible 
to measure precisely, at 
the same time, the position 



and the momentum of a 
particle. Likewise it is 
impossible to measure 
precisely, at the same 
time, the value of a field 
and the way the field is 
changing over time, 
helium The second lightest 
of the chemical elements. 
The nucleus of a helium 
atom contains two protons 
and either one or two 
neutrons. There are two 



electrons orbiting the 
nucleus. 

homogeneous Having the 
same quality and 
appearance at all places. 

hydrogen The lightest of the 
chemical elements. The 
nucleus of ordinary 
hydrogen consists of just 
one proton. There is a 
single electron orbiting the 
nucleus. Hydrogen is 
fused into helium in the 



cores of stars, 
imaginary numbers 

Numbers that when 
squared give a negative 
result. Thus the square of 
imaginary two is minus 
four. The square root of 
minus nine is imaginary 
three. 

imaginary time Time 

measured using imaginary 
numbers. 

inflationary-universe 



model Model in which the 

early universe went 

through a short period of 

extremely rapid 

expansion, 
initial conditions The 

boundary conditions at the 

beginning of the universe, 

before any time 

whatsoever had passed, 
isotropic Looking the same 

in all directions, 
microwave radiation 



Electromagnetic radiation 
that has wavelengths 
longer than those of 
visible light and shorter 
than radio waves. The 
particles of microwave 
radiation, as of all 
radiation in the 
electromagnetic spectrum, 
are photons. A 
background of microwave 
radiation that we detect in 
the universe is evidence 



used to support the idea of 
the Big Bang model. 
N=8 supergravity A theory 
that attempts to unify all 
the particles, both bosons 
and fermions, in a 
supersymmetric family, 
and to unify the forces. 
This was the theory 
Hawking spoke of in his 
1980 Lucasian Lecture 
and which he thought 
might turn out to be the 



Theory of Everything, 
naked singularity A 

singularity that is not 
hidden inside an event 
horizon. 

neutron One of the particles 
that make up the nucleus 
of an atom. Neutrons have 
no electrical charge. Every 
neutron is made up of 
three smaller particles 
called quarks. 

neutron star The final stage 



of a star that is too 
massive to form a white 
dwarf star but not massive 
enough to collapse to a 
black hole. 
Newton's theory of gravity 
Each body in the universe 
is attracted towards every 
other by a force that is 
stronger the more massive 
the bodies are and the 
closer they are to one 
another. Stated more 



precisely: bodies attract 
each other with a force 
that is proportional to the 
product of their masses 
and inversely proportional 
to the square of the 
distance between them. 

no-boundary proposal The 
idea that the universe is 
finite but has no boundary 
(in imaginary time). 

nucleus The central part of 
an atom, made up of 



protons and neutrons 
(which in turn are made up 
of quarks). The nucleus is 
held together by the strong 
force, 
optical telescope A 
telescope that produces 
images of stars and 
galaxies in the part of the 
electromagnetic spectrum 
that is visible to human 
eyes. 

particle pairs Pairs of 



particles that are being 
created everywhere in the 
vacuum and all the time. 
They are usually thought 
to be virtual particles, are 
extremely short-lived, and 
cannot be detected except 
indirectly by observing 
their effect on other 
particles. In a fraction of a 
second the two particles in 
a pair must find each other 
again and annihilate one 



another, 
photon The messenger 
particle of the 
electromagnetic force. At 
our level, photons show up 
as visible light and as all 
the other radiation in the 
electromagnetic spectrum, 
such as radio waves, 
microwaves, X-rays and 
gamma rays. Photons have 
zero mass and move at the 
speed of light. 



Planck length Thought to be 
the smallest meaningful 
length. It is 10" 33 
centimetres. 

positron Antiparticle of the 
electron. It has positive 
electric charge. 

primordial black hole Tiny 
black hole created not by 
the collapse of a star but 
the pressing together of 
matter in the very early 
universe. According to 



Hawking the most 
interesting ones are about 
the size of the nucleus of 
an atom, with a mass of 
about a billion tons. 

proton One of the particles 
that make up the nucleus 
of the atom. Protons have 
a positive electric charge. 
Every proton is made up 
of three smaller particles 
called quarks. 

psychological arrow of time 



Our everyday experience 
of the way time passes, 
from past to future. 

pulsar A neutron star that 
rotates very rapidly and 
sends out regular pulses of 
radio waves. 

quantum fluctuations The 
constant appearance and 
disappearance of virtual 
particles that occur in 
what we think of as empty 
space (the vacuum). 



quantum gravity The 

scientific theory that 
successfully unites general 
relativity and quantum 
mechanics. At present we 
do not have such a theory, 
quantum mechanics or 
quantum theory The 
theory developed in the 
1920s that we use to 
describe the very small, 
generally things the size of 
the atom and smaller. 



According to the theory, 
light, X-rays and any other 
waves can only be emitted 
or absorbed in certain 
'packages' called 'quanta'. 
For instance, light occurs 
in quanta known as 
photons, and it can't be 
divided up into smaller 
'packages' than one 
photon. You can't have 
half a photon, for 
example, or one and three- 



quarter photons. In 
quantum theory, energy is 
said to be 'quantized'. The 
theory includes the 
uncertainty principle. 

quantum wormhole A 
wormhole of an 
unimaginably small size. 
{See also wormhole .) 

quarks The fundamental 
particles (meaning they 
can't be divided into 
anything smaller) which, 



banded together in groups 
of three, make up protons 
and neutrons. Quarks also 
band together in groups of 
two (one quark and one 
antiquark) to form 
particles called mesons, 
radio waves 

Electromagnetic waves 
with longer wavelengths 
than those of visible light. 
The particles of radio 
waves, as of all radiation 



in the electromagnetic 

spectrum, are photons, 
radioactivity The 

spontaneous breakdown of 

one type of atomic nucleus 

into another, 
radius The shortest distance 

from the centre of a circle 

or sphere to the 

circumference or surface, 
renormalization A process 

that is used to remove 

infinities from a theory. It 



involves putting in other 
infinities and allowing the 
infinities to cancel one 
another out. 
second law of 
thermodynamics 
Entropy, the amount of 
disorder, in an isolated 
system can only increase, 
never decrease. If two 
systems join, the entropy 
of the combined system is 
as great as or greater than 



the entropy of the two 
systems added together. 

singularity A point in 
spacetime at which 
spacetime curvature 
becomes infinite, a point 
of infinite density. Some 
theories predict that we 
will find a singularity at 
the centre of a black hole 
or at the beginning or end 
of the universe. 

solar mass Mass equalling 



the mass of our sun. 

spacetime The combination 
of the three dimensions of 
space and one dimension 
of time. 

spacetime curvature 
Einstein's theory of 
general relativity explains 
the force of gravity as the 
way the distribution of 
mass or energy in 
spacetime causes 
something that resembles 



the warping, denting and 
dimpling in an elastic 
surface by heavy pellets of 
different weights and sizes 
lying on it. 
strong nuclear force The 
strongest of the four 
fundamental forces of 
nature. It holds the quarks 
together, in neutrons and 
protons for instance, and is 
responsible for the way 
protons and neutrons hold 



together in the nucleus. 
The messenger particle 
(boson) of the strong force 
is the gluon. 

supernova An enormous 
explosion of a star in 
which all but the inner 
core is blown off into 
space. The material blown 
off in a supernova forms 
the raw material for new 
stars and for planets. 

superstring theory The 



theory that explains the 
fundamental objects in the 
universe not as pointlike 
particles but as tiny strings 
or loops of string. It is a 
leading candidate for 
unifying all the particles 
and forces. 
Theory of Everything 
Sometimes called the 
TOE, this is the nickname 
for the theory that explains 
the universe and 



everything that happens in 
it. 

thermodynamic arrow of 
time Entropy (disorder) 
increases over time. 

uncertainty principle A 

particle cannot have both a 
definite position and a 
definite momentum at the 
same time. The more 
precisely you measure the 
one, the less accurate your 
measurement of the other 



will be. Similarly you 
cannot measure precisely 
the value of a field and its 
rate of change over time. 
There are other pairs of 
quantities that present the 
same problem. The 
uncertainty principle was 
discovered by the German 
physicist Werner 
Heisenberg and is more 
properly called the 
Heisenberg uncertainty 



principle. 

unified theory A theory that 
explains all four forces as 
one 'superforce' showing 
up in different ways and 
that also unites both 
fermions and bosons in a 
single family. 

vacuum energy The energy 
that is there in what we 
think of as empty space. 

velocity The speed at which 
something is moving away 



from some fixed place, 
and the direction in which 
it is moving. 

virtual particle In quantum 
mechanics a particle that 
can never be directly 
detected, but whose 
existence we know about 
because we can measure 
its effect on other 
particles. 

W + , W", Z° The messenger 
particles (bosons) of the 



weak force. 

wave function In quantum 
theory, a wave function 
describes all the possible 
paths a particle could 
follow between two 
points. If the value of the 
wave function is high for a 
particular path, then the 
particle is more likely to 
be found on that path. 

wave function of the 
universe Hartle and 



Hawking treat the universe 
like a quantum particle. 
The Hartle-Hawking 
wave function of the 
universe represents all the 
physically possible 
histories our universe 
might have. If the value of 
the wave function is high 
for a history, then that is a 
more likely history, 
wavelength The distance 
from one wave crest to the 



next. 

weak nuclear force One of 

the four fundamental 
forces of nature. The 
messenger particles 
(bosons) of the weak force 
are the W + , W", and the Z 
°. The weak force is 
responsible for 
radioactivity, such as a 
type called beta 
radioactivity in the nuclei 
of atoms.

Suggested Further 
Reading 



All of Stephen Hawking 's 
non-academic books (listed in 
Bibliography below). Black 
Holes and Baby Universes 
and A Brief History of Time: 
A Reader's Companion 
include particularly 
interesting accounts 
(autobiographical and from 



relatives and close 
acquaintances) of his 
childhood and university 
years and his life outside of 
science. 

Jane Hawking 's two 
memoirs, Music to Move the 
Stars and Travelling to 
Infinity: My Life with 
Stephen. These provide the 
most in-depth account ever 
likely to be written of their 
life together. 



The three children's 
books on which Lucy 
Hawking and Stephen 
Hawking have collaborated. 
Though fictional, these 
include superb explanations 
at a non-academic level of the 
science that has most 
interested Stephen Hawking: 
George's Secret Key to the 
Universe, George 's Cosmic 
Treasure Hunt, and George 
and the Big Bang. 



Kristine Larsen's 
excellent, succinct biography, 
Stephen Hawking: A 
Biography, written by a 
scientist who works in 
Stephen Hawking 's field and 
writes well for non-scientists.

About the Author 



Kitty Ferguson first became 
acquainted with Stephen 
Hawking and his family when 
she and her husband and 
children lived in Cambridge 
in the late 1980s. Around that 
time she retired from her 
career as a professional singer 
and conductor and began 



writing and lecturing about 
science and scientists for 
readers and audiences with 
little or no scientific 
background. Her seven books 
have appeared to critical 
acclaim all over the world, in 
twenty-seven languages. In 
2000 she worked with 
Hawking, helping edit his 
book The Universe in a 
Nutshell. 



Kitty grew up in San 
Antonio, Texas, moved to 
New York City at the age of 
nineteen to study at the 
Juilliard School of Music, and 
lived for forty-eight years in 
New York City and Chester, 
New Jersey. She and her 
husband now divide their 
time between Cambridge and 
South Carolina. They have 
three grown children and two 
grandchildren.
